00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,720
where we discuss science

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,920
and science-based tools for everyday life.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,240
I'm Andrew Huberman,

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,240
and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,220
at Stanford School of Medicine.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,520
Today we are discussing tools for mood and mental health.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,240
I will include tools and resources

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,440
taken from the guest episode that I did

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,560
with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,360
who is a psychologist and neuroscientist

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,640
whose laboratory focuses on mood and emotions.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,480
During that episode, she mentioned several important tools

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,320
that I do believe everybody should apply

15
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,440
and that indeed I've been applying to my own life

16
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,360
and have found to be extremely beneficial.

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,240
I will also highlight

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,400
some of the specific research articles

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,880
those tools are based on,

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,480
which were not covered in the podcast with Lisa.

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,040
I will also discuss tools gleaned

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,160
from the four episode series that I did on mental health

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,640
with Dr. Paul Conti,

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,680
who is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry.

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,240
And that episode, as some of you may already know,

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,980
focused on mental health and the self,

27
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,680
as well as relationships.

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,200
And it included a deep discussion of what is the self.

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,920
We talked about the unconscious mind and the conscious mind.

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,680
And we also covered a lot of tools

31
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,360
for understanding oneself,

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,340
both within the context of therapy,

33
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,480
but also within the context of things

34
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,620
that one can do alone and that require zero cost.

35
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,900
In addition, we talked about tools

36
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,300
for improving relationships.

37
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,140
We talked about first principles of self care.

38
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,980
So I will provide highlights and takeaways

39
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,300
of those tools during today's episode.

40
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,900
And thirdly, I will include tools,

41
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,300
what we often refer to as protocols,

42
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,340
gleaned from some recent publications.

43
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,940
Indeed, publications that came out

44
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,420
as recently as two weeks ago,

45
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,140
which really emphasize specific things that we can all do

46
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,060
that again are zero cost,

47
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,460
that have been shown in quality peer reviewed research

48
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,520
to significantly improve mood and mental health.

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,040
For instance, if you're a regular listener of this podcast,

50
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,520
you are probably familiar with my nearly constant reminder

51
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
that people should view morning sunlight

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,680
and afternoon sunlight.

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,800
And if you can't, to embrace some alternatives

54
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,400
like looking at bright artificial light,

55
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,180
although sunlight is best.

56
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,720
Well, there was a recent paper published

57
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,280
in the journal, Nature Mental Health, an excellent journal,

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,720
focusing on not just the positive effects

59
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,440
of viewing light at those times of day

60
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,080
and indeed throughout the day,

61
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,260
but also the independent and positive effects

62
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,280
of being in darkness for six to eight hours every night.

63
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,120
That's right.

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,400
Not only is light during the day correlated

65
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,140
with significantly improved mental health outcomes,

66
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,960
but darkness at night that is avoiding lights,

67
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,680
not just bright lights, but lights for up to eight hours

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,280
at certain periods of your 24 hour circadian cycle

69
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,920
has been correlated with improved mental health outcomes.

70
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,200
And indeed has been shown to significantly offset

71
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,080
certain negative mental health outcomes.

72
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,200
This is a spectacular study.

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Again, it involved a enormous number of research subjects,

74
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,400
more than 85,000 research subjects.

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,620
And it touches on a large number of actionable protocols

76
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,780
that I've distilled down to just one or two things

77
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,720
that all of us can easily do to improve our mood

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,960
and mental health on a consistent basis.

79
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,680
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,440
is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

81
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,740
It is however, part of my desire and effort

82
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,420
to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

83
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,060
and science related tools to the general public.

84
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,140
In keeping with that theme,

85
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,980
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

86
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,140
Our first sponsor is Plunge.

87
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,620
Plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile

88
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,340
at home self-cooling cold plunge

89
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,220
for deliberate cold exposure.

90
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,740
I've covered the topic of deliberate cold exposure

91
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,220
several times on this podcast.

92
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,660
Indeed, we did an entire episode

93
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,340
about deliberate cold exposure.

94
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,020
And what's very clear from the research literature

95
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,300
is that deliberate cold exposure

96
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,240
can induce dramatic positive shifts

97
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,340
in so-called catecholamines.

98
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,660
That is dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.

99
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,500
This is a small collection of molecules

100
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,920
that are released in the brain and body

101
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,780
when we do deliberate cold exposure.

102
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,300
And that subjectively lead to greatly enhanced feelings

103
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,040
of mood alertness and focus for many hours afterwards.

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,540
That's perhaps the best substantiated reason

105
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,120
and the most popular reason

106
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,740
why people who get into deliberate cold exposure,

107
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,040
no pun intended,

108
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,020
continue to do deliberate cold exposure

109
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,340
on a consistent basis.

110
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,060
Plunge uses a powerful and very easy to use

111
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,980
cooling filtration and sanitation unit

112
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,860
to give you access to deliberate cold exposure

113
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,900
in clean water whenever you want.

114
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,780
I've used a Plunge for several years now,

115
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,920
and I really like it because first of all,

116
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,500
it can use a standard outlet.

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,080
You don't have to modify the electricity

118
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,940
in your home or yard, and it's very easy to clean.

119
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,540
In fact, it stays clean for long periods of time,

120
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,140
which makes it very easy to maintain as well.

121
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,480
Plunge has several different models

122
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,060
to select from, including their new all-in cold Plunge,

123
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,440
which offers faster cooling,

124
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,700
smartphone connectivity, and more.

125
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,060
If you're interested in getting a Plunge,

126
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,060
you can go to Plunge, spelled P-L-U-N-G-E.com slash Huberman

127
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,600
to get $150 off your cold Plunge.

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,040
Again, that's plunge.com slash Huberman to get $150 off.

129
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,900
Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.

130
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,080
8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,

131
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,360
heating, and sleep tracking capacity.

132
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
I've spoken many times before in this podcast

133
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,740
about the fact that sleep,

134
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,000
that is getting enough quality sleep on a consistent basis,

135
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,480
is the foundation of mental health,

136
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,840
physical health, and performance.

137
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
Now, one of the key things

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,720
to getting the best possible night's sleep

139
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,020
is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment,

140
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,020
and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,

141
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,600
your body temperature needs to drop

142
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,360
by about one to three degrees.

143
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,040
And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,

144
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,080
your body temperature actually has to increase

145
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,760
by about one to three degrees.

146
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,400
With 8 Sleep, controlling the temperature

147
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,080
of your sleeping environment is made extremely easy.

148
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,360
8 Sleep mattress covers allow you to program

149
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,680
the temperature of your sleeping environment

150
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,860
at the beginning, middle, and end of your night.

151
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,120
It can even divide the temperature

152
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,080
on the two sides of the bed for different people.

153
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,680
It also has sleep tracking capacity.

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,200
It will tell you how much slow wave sleep

155
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,840
and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,

156
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,440
and really help you dial in the exact parameters

157
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,680
so you can get the best possible night's sleep.

158
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,360
I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover

159
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,840
for well over two years now,

160
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,040
and it has significantly improved my sleep,

161
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,240
and therefore my daytime mood focus and alertness.

162
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,520
If you'd like to try 8 Sleep,

163
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,080
you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman

and save up to $150 off their pod three covers.

165
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,040
8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,

166
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,080
select countries in the EU, and Australia.

167
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,320
Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.

168
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,360
Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.

169
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,120
Waking Up is a meditation app

170
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,280
that includes hundreds of meditation programs,

171
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,680
mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions,

172
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,720
and NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocols.

173
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,040
I started using the Waking Up app a few years ago

174
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,760
because even though I've been doing regular meditation

175
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,840
since my teens, and I started doing yoga nidra

176
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,720
about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me

177
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,960
that he had found an app,

178
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,720
turned out to be the Waking Up app,

179
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,760
which could teach you meditations of different durations

180
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,240
and that had a lot of different types of meditations

181
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,800
to place the brain and body into different states,

182
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,120
and that he liked it very much.

183
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
So I gave the Waking Up app a try,

184
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,880
and I too found it to be extremely useful

185
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,920
because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate,

186
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,640
other times I have longer to meditate,

187
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,520
and indeed I love the fact that I can explore

188
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,360
different types of meditation

189
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,560
to bring about different levels of understanding

190
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,120
about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body

191
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,760
into lots of different kinds of states

192
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
depending on which meditation I do.

193
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,280
I also love that the Waking Up app

194
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,960
has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions.

195
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,120
For those of you who don't know,

196
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,680
yoga nidra is a process of lying very still,

197
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,960
but keeping an active mind.

198
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,120
It's very different than most meditations,

199
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,200
and there's excellent scientific data

200
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,800
to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it

201
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,480
called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR

202
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,520
can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy

203
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,000
even with just a short 10 minute session.

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,920
If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,

205
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,800
you can go to wakingup.com slash Huberman

206
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,840
and access a free 30 day trial.

207
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,680
Again, that's wakingup.com slash Huberman

208
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,040
to access a free 30 day trial.

209
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,400
Okay, let's talk about tools

210
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
for improving mood and mental health.

211
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,160
I think it goes without saying

212
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,200
that these are extremely important topics

213
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,640
for everyone not just to know about,

214
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,080
but in my opinion, also for people to implement.

215
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,800
And the reason is that we are currently

216
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
in a worldwide mental health crisis.

217
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,440
And while we could debate the reason

218
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
why we are in a worldwide mental health crisis,

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,760
it's very, very clear that mood disorders

220
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,840
and challenges with mental health abound.

221
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,600
And of course, there are many different therapies

222
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,160
for the treatment of mood disorders and mental health,

223
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,240
everything from talk therapy with a psychologist

224
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,640
or a psychiatrist or social worker,

225
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,040
prescription drug treatments,

226
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,680
their nutritional approaches, somatic approaches.

227
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
And I want to be clear that I do believe

228
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,040
that there's value in all of these approaches.

229
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,600
What tends to matter in terms of what sorts of tools

230
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,480
and approaches one adopts includes both access,

231
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,720
so whether or not people have access

232
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,680
to these types of therapies,

233
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,920
whether or not they can afford them on a consistent basis,

234
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,160
and also, of course, the severity of the mood

235
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,640
or mental health disorder.

236
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,200
And I'd be remiss, of course,

237
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
if I didn't make the statement,

238
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,160
and I don't say this just to protect me,

239
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,880
I also say this to protect all of you

240
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,160
and those that you know,

241
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,000
that if you are concerned about yourself or somebody else

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,160
having a serious mood or mental health disorder,

243
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,880
please do seek out help from a licensed clinical psychologist

244
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,320
or psychiatrist or other healthcare professional

245
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,120
who's qualified to help you in that regard.

246
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
With that said, we can now have a discussion

247
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
about tools and protocols for enhancing mood

248
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,600
and mental health that truly apply to everybody,

249
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,360
regardless of age.

250
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,120
To start off, I wanna talk about a fundamental aspect

251
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,720
of mood and mental health enhancement

252
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,920
that was discussed both in the guest episode

253
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,520
with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

254
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,640
as well as in the guest series with Dr. Paul Conti.

255
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,880
And that has to do with what Dr. Paul Conti referred to

256
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,400
as the first principles of self-care or mental health.

257
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
The first principles of self-care include,

258
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,920
but are not limited to,

259
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,640
taking excellent care of one's biology,

260
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,560
which of course includes both the mind and the body.

261
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,680
And in order to make this very simple and actionable,

262
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:10,480
I've distilled out what I refer to as the big six.

263
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,640
I've sometimes referred to these

264
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,440
as the six major pillars of health,

265
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,280
both mental health and physical health,

266
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,480
as well as performance for that matter.

267
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,120
But if we're going to talk about tools

268
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,880
for mood and mental health,

269
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,240
we absolutely can't discard discussions about our biology.

270
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,000
That is, we need to make sure that we're taking care

271
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,960
of our normal biological function

272
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,880
and indeed enhancing the production

273
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,920
of specific neurotransmitters and neuromodulators

274
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,360
that we are optimizing.

275
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,240
Yes, I use the word optimizing.

276
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,400
The function of our so-called autonomic nervous system,

277
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,840
that aspect of our nervous system

278
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,880
that's humming in the background all the time.

279
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
It's operating unconsciously

280
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,720
to regulate our sleep-wake cycles.

281
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,720
It's regulating how well or poorly we react to things.

282
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
It's regulating how much dopamine, serotonin,

283
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,160
epinephrine, acetylcholine we're producing.

284
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,280
All of this stuff is humming in the background

285
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,000
and sets the stage for all the conscious work

286
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,080
that we might put to, for instance,

287
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,480
trying to understand what our life narrative is,

288
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,040
what our unconscious mind is doing,

289
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,880
what sorts of defenses am I producing,

290
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,160
all of the sort of high-level and directed work

291
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,960
that we're going to talk about a little bit later

292
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,240
exists on a background of autonomic function,

293
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,880
of neurotransmitter production, of hormone production,

294
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,360
not just testosterone and estrogen,

295
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,440
but things like cortisol, prolactin and on and on.

296
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,920
So it's important to understand that if our goal

297
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,320
is to be in the best possible mood

298
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,720
given our life circumstances

299
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,520
and to have the best possible mental health

300
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,880
given our life circumstances

301
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,240
and to improve our mood and mental health

302
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,680
consistently over time,

303
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,600
that we have to pay attention to what I'm referring to here

304
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:52,720
as the big six or the six pillars of mental health.

305
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,760
And those are, just to list them off,

306
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,040
then I'll go into a little bit more detail,

307
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,720
sleep, sunlight, although I'd like to modify sunlight

308
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,960
because based on some new data

309
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,480
that just came out a couple of weeks ago,

310
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,200
I'd like to now make that second pillar,

311
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,680
not sunlight, but light slash dark.

312
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,880
So we could even just think about it as a light,

313
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,360
when and how much light you get.

314
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,040
But what you'll soon learn is that how much dark you get

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,680
is also extremely important.

316
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,560
So we've got sleep, light, movement is the third,

317
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,320
nutrition, social connection, and stress control.

318
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,000
Now, these are topics that I've spoken about extensively

319
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
on previous Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.

320
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,240
So I don't want to go into a deep dive

321
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,760
of each of these six pillars right now,

322
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,560
but I am going to just give you a few highlights of each.

323
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,120
And then of course, we will provide links

324
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,280
in the show note captions

325
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,480
for which you can go on the deep dive if you like.

326
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,920
And I also would like to mention that

327
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,560
if you ever have questions about specific protocols

328
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
or tools and you're seeking those out

329
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,440
to our previous episodes or specific timestamps

330
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,400
of previous episodes of this podcast,

331
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,760
you can go to our newly revamped hubermanlab.com website

332
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,520
and put any topic of interest

333
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,320
or even several topics of interest into the search function.

334
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,760
And it will take you to the very specific timestamps

335
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,800
and other resources that provide information on those topics.

336
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,120
So I'm going to go into a few of the key bullet points

337
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,960
about each of the six pillars,

338
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,160
or what I also refer to as the big six

339
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,040
of self-care and mental health.

340
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,680
Again, this is a necessary list, but is not sufficient.

341
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,240
Again, necessary to do these things every 24 hours,

342
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,240
indeed, every 24 hours,

343
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,460
if you want to have the best possible mood

344
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,000
and mental health, but it is not sufficient.

345
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,760
That means you still need to do some of the other things

346
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,240
that we're going to talk about

347
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
in terms of directed approaches

348
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,200
at improving mood and mental health.

349
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,080
If you are to quote unquote,

350
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,800
optimize your mood and mental health,

351
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,160
or if you are, let's just say,

352
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,600
trying to constantly improve your mood and mental health.

353
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,160
But these are the necessary,

354
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,680
but not sufficient pillars of mental health.

355
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,520
So under the heading of sleep,

356
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,960
it's safe to say that most people need

357
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,920
between six to eight hours of sleep per night.

358
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,620
Some people can get away with five.

359
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,880
Some people need as much as nine or 10.

360
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,920
Certainly growing kids, babies, teenagers,

361
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,880
and those that are suffering from some sort of illness

362
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,680
are going to need more, as much as nine, 10,

363
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,980
maybe even 12 hours of sleep per night.

364
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,480
However, most people do well to get somewhere

365
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,920
between six and eight hours of sleep per night.

366
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,420
You're just going to have to experiment

367
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,800
and figure out what's best for you.

368
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,960
Now, one thing I heard recently,

369
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,320
so I can't claim this as an original idea,

370
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,460
but that I think is a really good way to think about sleep,

371
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:39,220
is that sleep, much like physical fitness,

372
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,920
is something that we have to constantly be working on.

373
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,840
It's not the sort of thing

374
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,560
where you can get a great night's sleep one night,

375
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,600
and then the next night,

376
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,480
just kind of let all the protocols go

377
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,400
and expect to get a great night's sleep.

378
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,600
You don't have to be neurotic

379
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,840
about getting a great night's sleep.

380
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,940
Indeed, I do believe that we should strive

381
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,880
to get enough quality sleep

382
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,160
as many of the nights of our life as possible,

383
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,320
and if you can't do that, hopefully it's for good reasons,

384
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,840
but of course, things happen in life, raising kids,

385
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,120
you have emergencies, all-nighters to study,

386
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,480
so you can make sure you get that best possible grade

387
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,900
on an exam, et cetera, et cetera,

388
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,060
but we should all strive to get the best quality sleep

389
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,340
that we can, and as much of it, most nights of our lives.

390
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,600
So it's important to look at sleep as a process

391
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,940
that you're going to be working on

392
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
for the rest of your life, just like fitness,

393
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,380
and I don't say that to overwhelm you,

394
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,360
I say that so that if on any given night

395
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,600
you get a poor night's sleep,

396
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,100
you don't stress that too much,

397
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,580
you just get right back on the wagon

398
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,180
and you try and get the best possible night's sleep

399
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,820
the next night and the next night and the next night,

400
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,820
much like fitness.

401
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,900
There's no 10-week program

402
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,580
that's going to transform your physical fitness forever,

403
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,980
just like there's no sleep program

404
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,600
that's going to transform your sleep forever.

405
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,520
It's a daily or rather, I should say, nightly investment,

406
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,360
although some of the things

407
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,800
that are going to positively impact your sleep

408
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,400
or perhaps damage your sleep

409
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,960
are things that you do during the daytime, right?

410
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,880
So avoid that caffeine too late in the day,

411
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,920
get that morning sunlight and on and on,

412
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,200
but view sleep as something

413
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,240
that you're constantly investing in,

414
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,660
and it is a critical investment

415
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,280
for your mood and mental health.

416
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,800
The other thing that's not often discussed,

417
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,680
and I really haven't talked about terribly much

418
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,360
on this podcast, is the importance

419
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,520
of having a fairly consistent sleep routine.

420
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,320
Now, I realize that not everybody can get to sleep

421
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,880
at the exact same time each night

422
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,040
and wake up at the exact same time each morning,

423
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,160
and frankly, that's not practical.

424
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,560
I certainly don't do that.

425
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,440
However, what we know from the circadian health literature

426
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,400
is that everybody should strive,

427
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,000
again, that's strive, nobody's perfect,

428
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,080
but strive to get to sleep

429
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,400
at more or less the same time each night

430
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,880
and wake up at more or less the same time each morning.

431
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,600
This turns out to be really important

432
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,080
for regulating mood and mental health,

433
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,480
and indeed for improving your overall levels of sleep,

434
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,040
getting the optimal amounts of slow wave sleep,

435
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,520
aka deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.

436
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,000
And what we know is that ideally you're going to get

437
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
to sleep within plus or minus one hour

438
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,280
of your regular sleep time.

439
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,680
So if your regular two bed time is 10 o'clock,

440
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,120
you're used to getting in bed at 10 o'clock

441
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,640
and falling asleep somewhere around 10.30.

442
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,760
Well, then if the next night you fall asleep at 9.30, great.

443
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,080
You're still within the plus or minus one hour.

444
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,520
And if the next night you go to sleep

445
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
and you don't fall asleep till 11.30, don't sweat it.

446
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,360
In fact, you're still within that plus or minus one hour.

447
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,680
However, if you start getting into a habit

448
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,920
of going to bed at vastly different times,

449
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,120
deviating more than or less than one hour

450
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,320
from your normal to bed time,

451
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,280
well, then you're going to start to run into issues

452
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,080
such as waking up feeling groggy,

453
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,040
even if you got enough sleep.

454
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,000
So even if you slept the full eight hours

455
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
that you're used to getting,

456
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,080
people who go to sleep much later than they normally do

457
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,720
or much earlier than they normally do

458
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,840
start getting into kind of issues of mood regulation,

459
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,640
energy regulation, not just in the morning,

460
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,720
but in the afternoon.

461
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,440
Likewise, try and wake up at more or less the same time

462
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
each morning, plus or minus one hour.

463
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,240
That's really going to help you anchor

464
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,800
your overall sleep schedule.

465
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,040
And it's really going to help lead to predictability

466
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,520
of your overall levels of energy, mood

467
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,040
and focus throughout the day.

468
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,880
The second pillar in that big six is light.

469
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,480
And I used to refer to this as sunlight, right?

470
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,320
I'd say, and I'm going to say it again now,

471
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,920
although I've covered this in a lot more detail.

472
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,080
So again, just hitting the top contour critical elements,

473
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,040
try to view sunlight, that is with your eyes,

474
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,720
view sunlight as early as possible after waking.

475
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,760
Whenever I say that, the most common question I get is,

476
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,800
what do I do if I wake up before the sun comes out?

477
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,680
Well, unless you have superpowers that I'm not aware of,

478
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,440
you can't make the sun come out any earlier.

479
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,320
So just flip on artificial lights as needed

480
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,520
until the sun comes out and then get outside,

481
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,920
face east in the morning, take off those sunglasses.

482
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,600
It's perfectly safe to look at low solar angle sunlight

483
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,040
without sunglasses, providing you're not driving

484
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,120
into bright light and you crash, this kind of thing.

485
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,840
Get outside, look at the sunlight,

486
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,840
definitely blink to protect your eyes as needed,

487
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,480
but get that sunlight in your eyes early in the day.

488
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,600
This has myriad positive effects on mood focus

489
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,640
and alertness and nighttime sleep later that night.

490
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,520
And it does so through a number of well-defined biological

491
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,960
and endocrine hormonal pathways that I've discussed

492
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,280
on many previous podcast episodes.

493
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,920
And you want to do this for about 10 minutes

494
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,720
on non-overcast days and as long as 20 or 30 minutes

495
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,240
on overcast days.

496
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,560
And that highlights the second most common question I get,

497
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,120
which is, what do I do if there's no sun where I live?

498
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,040
I live in an area where there's no sunlight.

499
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:25,640
Look, if you live on planet earth, there's always sunlight.

500
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,000
There might not be very much of it.

501
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,840
That might be very overcast where you live.

502
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,320
It might seem very dark, but trust me,

503
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,080
there's far more photons, light energy coming

504
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,240
through that cloud cover,

505
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,880
even in the darkest mornings of winter,

506
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,800
than there are at night in those dark winters.

507
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,880
So get that light in your eyes

508
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,560
and do it as consistently as possible

509
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,040
and also do that in the late afternoon and evening.

510
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,640
That's critical for regulating your circadian clock

511
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,680
for reasons that I've talked about previously,

512
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,360
but I'll get into in a future podcast,

513
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
really explaining how those clock oscillators

514
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,640
and mechanisms work.

515
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,920
But just to keep it really simple,

516
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,640
since this is a toolkit episode

517
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,120
for mood and mental health,

518
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,920
your mood and your mental health will benefit tremendously

519
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,880
from getting morning sunlight in your eyes.

520
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,520
Now, if you need to get more light in your eyes,

521
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,680
because indeed there's just not enough sunlight

522
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,200
or you don't have the opportunity to get outside

523
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,360
and view sunlight in the morning for whatever reason,

524
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,840
you might invest in getting a bright light source

525
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,680
that you can plug in.

526
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,760
You probably want one that's as bright as 10,000 lux.

527
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,280
So that's pretty bright.

528
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,720
Those fall under the category of so-called SAD lamps,

529
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,240
seasonal effective disorder lamps.

530
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,480
And you can purchase those.

531
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,160
They can be somewhat expensive.

532
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,580
You can also opt to get a 900 lux drawing tablet.

533
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,240
By the way, I have no financial relationship

534
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,400
to any of these sorts of light sources,

535
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,960
but you can find them pretty easily.

536
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,560
And in the case of the 900 lux light tablet,

537
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,000
fairly inexpensively online.

538
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,380
And you can put that on your desk

539
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,640
or where you have your morning coffee

540
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,440
and try and enhance the total amount of light

541
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
that you're getting in the morning.

542
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,680
But frankly, nothing is as good as sunlight.

543
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,900
So if you can't get sunlight,

544
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,640
you might think about investing in one of those SAD lamps.

545
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,160
And indeed those SAD lamps aren't as good as sunlight,

546
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,480
but they are the next best thing

547
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,300
if you really can't get sunlight on a consistent basis.

548
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,760
A few other fine points that I always get asked about.

549
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,000
First of all, it is absolutely okay

550
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,400
to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses.

551
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,640
Those sorts of corrective lenses

552
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,360
are actually going to focus the light to your retina,

553
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,320
which is where you want it.

554
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,700
However, this whole process of viewing morning sunlight

555
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,240
in afternoon light does not, again,

556
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,680
does not work through a window or windshield

557
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,320
because windows and windshields

558
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,360
filter out the relevant wavelengths of light

559
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,680
that you want to get directly onto your retina.

560
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,800
Okay, so that's the reality of it.

561
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,360
In addition, please don't feel

562
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,120
that you have to look directly at the sun

563
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,080
and certainly don't stare at the sun.

564
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,040
Never force yourself to look at any light,

565
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,140
sunlight or otherwise,

566
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,440
that's so bright that it's painful to look at.

567
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,000
So if it's comfortable for you to look directly at the sun

568
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,200
and just blink every once in a while

569
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,300
and you can do that without any pain or discomfort

570
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,320
or watering of the eyes, please do that.

571
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,880
You're getting a lot of photons into your eyes

572
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,400
and they're transmitting that to your brain

573
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,920
and your brain to the rest of your body and on and on.

574
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,380
However, if you find it uncomfortable

575
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,720
to look directly at the sun,

576
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,560
in that case, what you'll want to do is offset your gaze

577
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,880
to 10 or 20 degrees, which is nerd speak

578
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,160
for just a little bit to the right

579
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,560
or a little bit to the left

580
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,000
and get the sunlight into your eyes indirectly.

581
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,480
Okay, and I often also get asked,

582
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,200
well, can I stand in the shade while I do this?

583
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,580
What if I have an overhang in my apartment?

584
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,400
The best thing is of course going to be

585
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,880
to face directly to the sun

586
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,480
and look either directly at it or slightly offset.

587
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,620
But if you can only get morning sunlight

588
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,160
by going out onto your balcony

589
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,960
and your balcony doesn't face east, rather it faces west,

590
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,320
you'll still get a lot of photons from the sun

591
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,480
reaching your eyes there.

592
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,960
But ideally you would find some way to look toward the sun

593
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,020
first thing in the morning.

594
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,180
I realized that with kids and work and other obligations,

595
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,180
this can be challenging,

596
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,580
but it is a challenge worth meeting.

597
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,320
Meaning don't lose your job

598
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,180
or forget to take care of your kids to do this,

599
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
but you can bring your kids to do this.

600
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,280
And indeed you should, it sets their circadian rhythms also.

601
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,660
And people often will ask, well, does it work on dogs?

602
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,940
You know, and indeed dogs and other animals

603
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,740
have these exact same circuits and pathways

604
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,200
for setting their circadian rhythm.

605
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,780
So it's great for them too.

606
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,520
Now there are also clear and documented benefits

607
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,620
for mood and mental health

608
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,020
to getting bright light in your eyes,

609
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,340
ideally from sunlight throughout the day,

610
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,600
as much as you safely can.

611
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,180
Please don't get sunburned,

612
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:22,500
don't get cataracts by getting too much sunlight,

613
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,580
but getting outdoors and getting sunlight in your eyes

614
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,140
during your lunch break or a walk here and there,

615
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,060
or if you have to remain indoors during the day,

616
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,280
getting the lights in that environment as bright as possible

617
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,120
as is safely possible, I should say,

618
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,800
is known to improve mood and mental health.

619
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,640
Why?

620
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,240
Well, because there's a special so-called opsin

621
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,900
within the cells of your eyes called melanopsin

622
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:47,580
that doesn't respond to the same differences in color

623
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,220
that are present in sunlight in the morning and the evening,

624
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,540
but rather responds to the overall brightness of light.

625
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,180
So very bright lights, either from artificial sources

626
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,660
or ideally from sunlight, activate these cells

627
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,180
and these cells project these little wires,

628
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,820
we call axons, into specific parts of the brain

629
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:06,980
that improve your mood and feelings of wellbeing.

630
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,660
So I can't give you a specific number

631
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,680
of five minutes a day or 10 minutes a day.

632
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,300
Just get as much light in your eyes,

633
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,260
ideally from sunlight throughout the day,

634
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,740
as is safe for you,

635
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,260
meaning where you're not getting sunburned

636
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,820
and you're not damaging your retina.

637
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,120
And if you want to know if you're damaging your retina,

638
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,820
well, anytime you have to blink or turn away from light

639
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:26,860
because it's really bright,

640
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,900
that's a signal that the light is too bright.

641
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,580
So while you want to place yourself into bright environments,

642
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,620
you don't want to place yourself into any environment

643
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,620
so bright that it's painful to be in.

644
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,460
Okay, so use that as a metric and you should be just fine.

645
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,060
And the last point about light for mood and mental health

646
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,900
is a relatively recent theme

647
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,860
that's emerging from the scientific literature

648
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:47,660
and that really was driven home by a recent study

649
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,260
that I mentioned a little bit earlier in the episode.

650
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,540
This is the study published in Nature Mental Health,

651
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,900
showing that darkness during a particular stage

652
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,460
of your 24 hour cycle,

653
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,260
your so-called circadian rhythm,

654
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,300
is also very beneficial for mood and mental health.

655
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,720
And it's beneficial for mood and mental health

656
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,060
in a way that is independent from light and from sleep.

657
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,260
Now, what do I mean by that?

658
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,940
Okay, well, there are a number of different ways

659
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,180
that this can be examined,

660
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,980
but in this particular study, which I like oh so much,

661
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:19,580
entitled Day and Night Light Exposure

662
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,980
are Associated with Psychiatric Disorders,

663
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,900
an objective light study in more than 85,000 people.

664
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,060
What the researchers did is they analyzed how much light

665
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,780
and or dark people were getting across the 24 hour cycle

666
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,860
and correlated that with mental health outcomes,

667
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,220
looking at a range of different mental health challenges,

668
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,900
including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression,

669
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,820
PTSD, and much more.

670
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,300
And I'll go into this study in a lot of detail

671
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,220
in a future episode,

672
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,580
cause it's such an important study

673
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,180
with so many gems within it that we should all know about.

674
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,680
But one of the key things from this study

675
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,180
is that the positive effects of daytime sunlight exposure

676
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:02,340
and the positive effects of nighttime dark exposure,

677
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,940
that means of course the absence of light,

678
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,300
are independent of one another.

679
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,980
Put differently, making sure that you're in very dim

680
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:13,640
to completely dark environments

681
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,760
for a continuous six to eight hours

682
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,620
within every 24 hours circadian cycle

683
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,040
is correlated with much better mental health outcomes.

684
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,720
In other words, we shouldn't just think about

685
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,080
the presence of light in the morning

686
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,040
and throughout the day as positive for mental health.

687
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,160
That's all true, it's absolutely true.

688
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,800
And this study further verifies that,

689
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,280
but that's been known for some time,

690
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,200
indeed decades from the scientific research.

691
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,420
And of course it's been known for thousands of years

692
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:42,080
intuitively and subjectively

693
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,380
without detailed scientific measurement.

694
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,880
But in addition to that,

695
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,160
this study shows that people who stay in very dim

696
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,560
to dark environments for eight hours every 24 hours,

697
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,920
or I should say approximately eight hours

698
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,900
in every 24 hour cycle,

699
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,080
they benefit from improved mood and mental health outcomes

700
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,740
in a way that's independent of how much light they're getting

701
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:09,300
and independent of how much sleep they are getting.

702
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,320
The point is this, the time when you wake up,

703
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,160
consider that time zero.

704
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,720
And then about, again,

705
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,500
you don't have to be super strict about this,

706
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,720
about 16 to 24 hours after that wake up time,

707
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,340
you should be in a very dim to dark environment

708
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,340
for that 16 hour to 24 hour period after waking up, okay?

709
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,760
What do I mean by this?

710
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,940
I mean, if you go to sleep at 10 PM

711
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,120
and you wake up at 6 AM,

712
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,460
well that 10 PM to 6 AM phase of your circadian cycle,

713
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,280
you should be in very dim light

714
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,180
or entirely dark environment.

715
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,320
This is a great opportunity to reference another study

716
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,120
which was published in the proceedings

717
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,440
of the National Academy of Sciences,

718
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,840
which shows that even having a small amount

719
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,920
of light in the room, which isn't even that bright,

720
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,000
while you're sleeping with eyes closed

721
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,800
can disrupt morning glucose levels.

722
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:01,520
So in other words, keep your sleeping environment dark,

723
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,440
keep your nighttime environment dim

724
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,960
to the best of your abilities, right?

725
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
Certainly go out to dinner every once in a while,

726
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,780
go to the movies, go out and have a party, enjoy yourself.

727
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,520
If you have to go to the hospital, God forbid,

728
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,040
or you have to tend to some emergency, do that.

729
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,200
But to the extent that you can control it

730
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,360
within the confines of life and its demands,

731
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,760
keep your nighttime environment dim or dark

732
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,320
because that independently of any sunlight

733
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,680
and other bright light that you're viewing

734
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,500
during the daytime and afternoon

735
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,460
is going to positively improve your mood and mental health.

736
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,920
Now moving on to the other pillars

737
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,280
and these I'm going to move through a bit more quickly

738
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,440
than I have the previous two

739
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,940
because we've done entire series on these,

740
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,480
or I should say seriesies, seriesies?

741
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,320
Is that how you pronounce it?

742
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,160
Someone put the plural of seriesies

743
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,440
in the comments on YouTube.

744
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,920
The third pillar is movement.

745
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,320
And when I say movement, I mean exercise.

746
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,460
As you all know, we should all strive to get anywhere

747
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:01,060
from 180 to 220 minutes of zone two cardio per week.

748
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,520
That's movement that allows you to hold a conversation,

749
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,200
but were you to do it more intensely,

750
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,400
or even a bit more intensely,

751
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,080
you wouldn't be able to hold that conversation.

752
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,280
In addition, we should do some VO2 max work.

753
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,200
We should get our heart rate very high

754
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,320
at least once a week,

755
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,920
doing some sort of movement that's safe for you.

756
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,160
So that could be running or cycling or swimming

757
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,960
or Pilates, whatever it is for you,

758
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,280
getting your heart rate way, way up is also important.

759
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,880
And to do that at least once a week,

760
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,400
but daily movement, either cardiovascular training

761
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,520
or resistance training.

762
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,840
And it's very, very clear that we need both,

763
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,180
maybe not on the same days.

764
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,360
In fact, I split them to separate days.

765
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,200
Resistance training done for anywhere from six to 10 sets

766
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,280
per muscle group, either close to or to failure.

767
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,080
This could be with weights, it could be with bands,

768
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,360
it could be with machines.

769
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,800
All of that was covered in detail in the podcast series

770
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,880
that I did with Dr. Andy Galpin, an exercise physiologist

771
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,180
who's expert in all those areas.

772
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,900
I also did an episode on a foundational fitness protocol

773
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:01,360
that has been distilled into a very simple three page PDF

774
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,440
that you can get for completely zero cost

775
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,000
by going to hubermanlab.com

776
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,120
and just put foundational fitness protocol PDF

777
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,600
and you'll be taken to that toolkit.

778
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,960
So all of the details of a weekly exercise routine

779
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,800
that involves daily movement, but also certainly in my case

780
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,560
includes at least one full day of rest per week,

781
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,580
because many people do indeed need one,

782
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,040
maybe even two full days of rest per week.

783
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,280
So that highlights the third pillar movement,

784
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,480
but we know that cardiovascular training

785
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,840
and resistance training aren't just great for our body.

786
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,600
They also improve mood and mental health.

787
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,400
That's so very clear from the research literature.

788
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,280
So we can't overlook those in a conversation

789
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,860
about mood and mental health.

790
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,040
Now the fourth pillar is nutrition.

791
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,560
And nutrition is a big topic.

792
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,960
It's a very barbed wire topic.

793
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,240
If you get involved in this stuff online,

794
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,840
you know, you've got your people who believe that,

795
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,600
you know, carnivore is better than vegan.

796
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,760
You have the people who believe vegan

797
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,680
is better than carnivore.

798
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,880
Most people are omnivores.

799
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,320
You have your seed oil debates and on and on and on.

800
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,240
We're not going to touch any of that now.

801
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,200
Indeed, if you want to learn more about nutrition

802
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,800
and what works and what doesn't work

803
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,960
for sake of aesthetic changes, weight loss,

804
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,880
muscle gain, et cetera,

805
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,280
I would refer you to the guest episode

806
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,360
that we did with Dr. Lane Norton.

807
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,160
You can find that again at hubermanlab.com

808
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,320
where we do a deep dive on all the variations

809
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,480
and different nutritional protocols.

810
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,300
But suffice to say that regardless of whether or not

811
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,100
you're vegan, omnivore, carnivore, or keto or whatever,

812
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,640
everybody needs to consume sufficient amounts,

813
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,380
but not excess amounts of quality calories per day.

814
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,040
Now you may do that by intermittent fasting.

815
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,720
You may do that by a more traditional meal scheduling,

816
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,880
but everybody's going to need to do that

817
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,680
because your body and brain,

818
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,360
and indeed the parts of your body and brain

819
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,760
that translate to mood and mental health

820
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,840
require macronutrients,

821
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,200
proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,

822
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,480
as well as micronutrients.

823
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,420
So the key takeaway with nutrition

824
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,400
is to make it quality nutrition

825
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,160
within the bounds of whatever sort of nutritional program

826
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,040
that you're following.

827
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,880
And that means getting most of your food sources

828
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,280
from either non-processed or minimally processed foods.

829
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,520
So these will be foods that you're going to need to prepare

830
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,720
or foods that would perish over time.

831
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,600
These are not the sorts of foods that live in boxes

832
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,360
and cans and other packages

833
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,800
that would allow them to live on the shelves

834
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,120
forever and ever.

835
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,520
Okay, and as I say that, I know many people are shouting,

836
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,880
well, what about rice?

837
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,540
Rice can live on the shelf for a long time.

838
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,520
And yes, okay, I consider rice a minimally processed food

839
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,080
because of course it can live on the shelf

840
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,000
for a long period of time.

841
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,560
And here I'm just going to back out of the whole conversation

842
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,800
about nutrition at this point,

843
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,160
because as you can probably tell,

844
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,800
it's a deep series of rabbit holes that we can fall into

845
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,760
and really get distracted.

846
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,280
The point is make sure you're getting enough food.

847
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,240
Don't overeat.

848
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,320
We know energy toxicity is a problem

849
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,120
for not just body composition, but for mental health.

850
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,520
So you want to get enough calories, but not too few calories.

851
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,160
And you'll want to make sure that you're getting them

852
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,640
from quality sources.

853
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,840
And I say that because of course,

854
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,000
food is not just the substrate for the seller repair

855
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,740
and indeed production of tissues in your body,

856
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,260
but it's also the substrate for all the sorts

857
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,920
of neurotransmitters, right?

858
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,040
Which are derived from amino acid precursors

859
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,080
that are derived from food, right?

860
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,560
All of that dopamine stuff and serotonin stuff

861
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,160
is derived from amino acids that come from food sources.

862
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,900
So the link between nutrition and mental health

863
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,480
should now be an obvious one.

864
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,040
As we all know, quality nutrition influences,

865
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,200
of course, our physical health,

866
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,920
but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning,

867
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,840
our memory, our ability to learn new things and to focus.

868
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,020
And we know that one of the most important features

869
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:33,960
of high quality nutrition is making sure

870
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,960
that we get enough vitamins and minerals

871
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,560
from high quality, unprocessed or minimally processed sources,

872
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,680
as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber

873
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,740
to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,

874
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,600
including the gut microbiome.

875
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,720
Now, I, like most everybody,

876
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,780
try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,

877
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,960
ideally mostly from minimally processed or non-processed foods.

878
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,440
However, one of the challenges that I

879
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,920
and so many other people face

880
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,000
is getting enough servings of high quality fruits

881
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,940
and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics

882
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:07,140
that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.

883
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,180
That's why way back in 2012,

884
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:13,040
long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.

885
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,620
And so I'm delighted that AG1

886
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,780
is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.

887
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,520
The reason I started taking AG1

888
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,800
and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day

889
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,600
is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.

890
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,560
That is, it provides insurance

891
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,920
that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins,

892
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,960
minerals, probiotics, and fiber

893
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,000
to ensure optimal mental health,

894
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,200
physical health, and performance.

895
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,600

Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman

901
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,240
to claim that special offer.

902
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,760
The fifth pillar in the big six is social connection.

903
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,120
And we're going to talk a little bit more

904
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,740
about this later in the episode,

905
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:59,320
but let's just be very brief and specific about this.

906
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,580
We all need to strive to limit the number

907
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:06,280
of social interactions that we feel tax

908
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,000
or even vex us that cause us stress.

909
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,720
This is something that was covered in depth

910
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,540
in the episode with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

911
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,080
where she talked about the fact

912
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,700
that we don't just have a nervous system

913
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,080
that regulates itself through experience

914
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,760
and through our thoughts and our actions.

915
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,400
We are, as a species, interacting with other nervous systems,

916
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,760
both of our own species, other humans,

917
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
as well as non-human species, dogs and cats,

918
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,600
and if you have them, horses and other animals.

919
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,240
So we need to think about our nervous system

920
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
as being both regulated from the inside

921
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,760
and through our own actions and choices and thoughts,

922
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,800
but also through interaction with other nervous systems.

923
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,200
And while we don't always have as much control

924
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,600
over which social interactions or work interactions

925
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,280
we have to engage in,

926
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,080
we should really strive to understand

927
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,260
and indeed pay some serious attention

928
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:57,400
to whether or not certain types of social interactions

929
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,420
are what she referred to as net savings,

930
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,040
neutral or taxing, right?

931
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,680
Certain types of social interactions

932
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,480
with certain people or groups of people

933
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,760
just make us feel taxed.

934
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,520
It makes us feel stressed.

935
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,600
It leads to negative affect.

936
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,720
That is not good feelings or emotions

937
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,520
and often elevated levels of autonomic arousal

938
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,800
that leave us ruminating

939
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,480
and leave us having challenges with sleep.

940
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,680
We really should all strive to limit those interactions

941
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,280
to the extent that we can.

942
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,520
On the reverse side of that,

943
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,760
as Lisa Feldman Barrett so beautifully pointed out,

944
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,980
we also have the capability

945
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,820
to regulate each other's nervous systems

946
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,080
in ways that produce savings,

947
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,400
that is, that allow us to feel

948
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,040
and indeed cause physiological changes

949
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,360
that make us feel not just happier, not just relaxed,

950
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,840
not just happy because we enjoy interacting with somebody

951
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,500
but we're a group, but that give us a savings,

952
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,360
that give us the kind of resources,

953
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,960
literally metabolic and neurochemical resources

954
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,640
that make us feel more capable

955
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
and give us a sense of elevated mood

956
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,580
and improved mental health

957
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,000
when we are not engaging with those people.

958
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,760
And this is highly subjective, of course,

959
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,240
but you should be able to distinguish.

960
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,880
In fact, I encourage you to spend a little bit of time,

961
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,520
maybe even just five or 10 minutes,

962
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,160
thinking about who are the individuals and groups

963
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,840
that I interact with that leave me feeling taxed,

964
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,080
that really seem to drain my energy

965
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,040
and have me ruminating and in a not good space

966
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,400
when I leave whatever interaction I had with them.

967
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,160
This could be a real interaction or an online interaction.

968
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,680
Indeed, I did this the other day based on Lisa's suggestion.

969
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,040
I found it to be tremendously useful.

970
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,640
What I did is I decided to,

971
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,400
and by the way, this was happening on a run

972
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,620
where I was thinking,

973
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,600
a lot of my mind is in a conversation with people

974
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,640
that aren't even here.

975
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,600
I was sort of working through a conversation.

976
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,080
I was thinking about what I would say,

977
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,280
what I did say, what they said,

978
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,480
in an interaction that unfortunately was pretty unpleasant.

979
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,800
It wasn't extremely unpleasant,

980
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
but it was pretty unpleasant.

981
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,040
And I realized, okay, that is a sort of interaction

982
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,560
that I would like to avoid in the future

983
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,380
because it wasn't happening right then,

984
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,420
but it was carried forward into a portion of my day,

985
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,880
my morning run that for me is normally very pleasurable

986
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,040
and quite sacred to me, actually.

987
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,520
So paying some attention

988
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,960
to how much of your internal dialogue is with yourself

989
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,160
versus with others and how much of that is positive

990
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,440
or negative is extremely beneficial.

991
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,920
And I'm not talking about always just thinking about oneself

992
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,040
and not thinking about others.

993
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,500
To the contrary, we also need to think,

994
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,600
as Lisa pointed out,

995
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,940
about who are the people with whom we interact with

996
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:34,400
or observe that lead us to have ongoing dialogue with them

997
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,520
in our mind or think about those interactions

998
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,200
in ways that give us energy,

999
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,220
that lead to energetic savings,

1000
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,540
literally metabolic savings that we can apply,

1001
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,580
not just in those interactions,

1002
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,620
but in our work endeavors and our solo endeavors,

1003
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,460
whatever that we're doing

1004
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,880
when we are away from those people.

1005
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,880
So while this concept of savings or neutral or taxation

1006
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,940
of our metabolic and our neurochemical systems

1007
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,380
might seem a little bit squishy, it is not squishy.

1008
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,900
This is a neurobiological concept.

1009
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,620
It's also a psychological concept.

1010
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:07,760
And it's one that I'm so glad that Lisa brought up

1011
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,800
because social connection, social interaction is so vital

1012
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,400
to our mood and mental health.

1013
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,880
But oftentimes we hear social connection and we think,

1014
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,840
oh, that means we have to spend a lot of time with friends.

1015
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,560
We have to organize dinner parties.

1016
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,680
Well, sure, that's all fine and good if you can do that.

1017
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,720
And I do, of course, encourage people to spend time

1018
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,680
with those that they love,

1019
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,580
but it's also important to take a step back

1020
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,240
and just think a bit, maybe even write out a bit,

1021
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,400
who are the groups and sorts of individuals

1022
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,760
and interactions that really tax you?

1023
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,880
Who are the people that you find kind of neutral?

1024
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,440
And what are the individuals and groups

1025
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,360
that really provide what Lisa referred to as savings?

1026
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,200
That is, they tap into the metabolic

1027
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,880
and neurochemical pathways that lead us

1028
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,840
to have improved mood and mental health,

1029
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,580
not just during those interactions,

1030
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,820
but away from those interactions as well,

1031
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,440
and often pervasively and extremely positively so.

1032
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,020
So this is no small deal.

1033
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,220
This is a really important aspect of our mental health.

1034
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,540
Now, the sixth pillar in the big six is stress control.

1035
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,340
And the reason it's included is that,

1036
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,780
look, stress is going to happen.

1037
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,860
Life is filled with so-called stressors.

1038
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,780
And for a good number of years, in fact, the last 15 years,

1039
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,380
there's been a lot of debate in the field of psychology

1040
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,340
and neuroscience as well,

1041
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,140
whether or not stress is good for us,

1042
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,420
whether or not stress is bad for us,

1043
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,340
whether or not we simply need to reframe stress

1044
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,180
as good or bad.

1045
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,420
And to some extent, all of that is true.

1046
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,780
We know that chronic stress is not good for our memory,

1047
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,580
our immune system, or our health.

1048
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,700
We also know that if you understand the reality,

1049
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,620
which is that stress also allows us to harness our mental

1050
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,700
and physical resources to perform better than we would

1051
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,580
otherwise in certain circumstances,

1052
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,220
and that provided we can get to sleep each night,

1053
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,940
that perhaps stress isn't so bad,

1054
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,180
and perhaps is even performance enhancing.

1055
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,700
I talked about this in the guest episode

1056
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,380
with Dr. Ali Krum from the psychology department at Stanford,

1057
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,940
and I've talked about this in other podcasts as well.

1058
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,060
And I'm not here to tell you that stress is good for you.

1059
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,740
I'm not here to tell you that stress is bad for you.

1060
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,340
What I am going to tell you is that it is extremely important

1061
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,460
that we all have readily accessible stress management tools

1062
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,380
that work the first time and every time.

1063
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,860
And these fall into two categories.

1064
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,140
The first category are real time tools.

1065
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,740
So tools that you can use to reduce your level of stress

1066
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,700
in real time.

1067
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,780
And the best way that I'm aware of that's grounded

1068
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,900
in excellent physiology and neuroscience

1069
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,820
to reduce your stress in real time

1070
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,740
is the so-called physiological side.

1071
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,700
I did not invent this pattern of breathing.

1072
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,660
It's not breath work per se.

1073
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,740
This is a pattern of breathing that we all naturally do

1074
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,700
in our sleep to restore carbon dioxide and oxygen levels

1075
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,220
to their proper ratios.

1076
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,940
We also do it periodically throughout the day

1077
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,900
without noticing.

1078
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,260
Indeed, we have a defined or specific neural circuit

1079
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,420
in our brain that extends to our diaphragm

1080
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,380
and communicates with aspects of our heart, et cetera,

1081
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,380
that allow physiological size to calm us down faster,

1082
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,820
at least to my knowledge, than any other directed protocol.

1083
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,860
And the physiological side, as many of you know,

1084
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,700
is very simple and straightforward.

1085
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,060
Anyone can do this.

1086
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:07,020
You simply do a big inhale through your nose,

1087
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,620
try and maximize the inflation of your lungs.

1088
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:11,580
And then before you exhale,

1089
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,660
sneak in another brief inhalation,

1090
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,620
even if it's just a tiny micro inhalation

1091
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,060
to maximally inflate the lungs.

1092
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,340
And that has an important effect on the little sacs

1093
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,420
in the lungs called the avioli of the lungs.

1094
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,340
It's going to open up whatever avioli were collapsed

1095
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,180
in there.

1096
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,260
And then you're going to do a long extended exhale

1097
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,500
through the mouth.

1098
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,300
And typically just one,

1099
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,900
although sometimes it requires two or three,

1100
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,540
but just one physiological sigh is effective

1101
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,100
in bringing down one's level of stress

1102
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,860
significantly enough that you don't need to do it again.

1103
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,500
So this can be done essentially anywhere and by anyone.

1104
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,060
I suppose you probably couldn't do it if you were underwater

1105
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,580
or certainly don't do it if you're underwater,

1106
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,540
but otherwise it's a very safe and very effective way

1107
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,740
to calm down and reduce your levels of stress

1108
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,940
in real time, maybe before public speaking

1109
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,340
or in whatever circumstance you feel you need to calm down

1110
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,580
in real time.

1111
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,940
So I'll demonstrate the physiological sigh for you here.

1112
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:06,780
I've done this many times before in previous episodes,

1113
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,180
but for those of you that haven't heard

1114
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,580
or seen those episodes,

1115
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,220
I feel obligated to do it again now.

1116
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:13,980
Okay, so it's a deep inhale through the nose

1117
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,740
followed by another brief inhale through the nose

1118
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,300
and then a long exhale through the mouth.

1119
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,100
And before you start asking questions about,

1120
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,700
what do I do if I have a deviated septum?

1121
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,060
Can it be just through the mouth?

1122
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,940
Do the first two through the nose,

1123
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,740
do the third through the mouth.

1124
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,700
So it's like this.

1125
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,860
And indeed I feel calmer.

1126
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:41,420
And indeed, if you do it, you will feel calmer.

1127
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,220
You'll notice that second inhale through the nose

1128
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:47,060
was kind of sharp in the sense that I had to really push,

1129
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,100
put some physical effort into making it happen.

1130
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,180
And my shoulders jolted upwards

1131
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,740
if you're just listening to this

1132
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,700
and not watching my shoulders jolted upwards.

1133
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,380
That second inhale through the nose is important

1134
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,460
for a variety of reasons I've talked about elsewhere.

1135
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,900
So the physiological sigh is going to be

1136
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,620
the go-to protocol for you.

1137
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,060
Again, not invented by me.

1138
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,300
This is not Huberman breathing.

1139
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,660
This is a pattern of breathing discovered in the 1930s

1140
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:10,620
by physiologists.

1141
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,420
It's hardwired into our nervous system.

1142
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,580
And that's what makes it so great.

1143
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,380
It works the first time and it works every time.

1144
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,860
So that's, to my knowledge,

1145
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,580
the best way to control your stress in real time.

1146
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,300
Now, why is that important for mood and mental health?

1147
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,580
Well, as we'll talk about later,

1148
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,300
if you want to access your so-called generative drive,

1149
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,580
a theme that we're going to get into in a bit more detail,

1150
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,580
this is something that came up during the series

1151
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,020
with Dr. Paul Conti,

1152
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:38,180
you will learn that stress and anger and negative emotions,

1153
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,100
while they can be very motivating, very arousing,

1154
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,580
they are not going to be good

1155
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,500
for your long-term mood and mental health, period.

1156
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,980
So having tools to regulate your stress

1157
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,460
and your levels of anger, your levels of reactivity,

1158
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:54,860
and also to elevate your feelings of agency

1159
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,100
and control over your life,

1160
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,500
starting with agency and control over your physiology,

1161
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:02,420
your internal state, is going to be vital.

1162
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,300
And what I love about the physiological side

1163
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,380
is that, of course, it's completely zero cost,

1164
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,060
but also there's a dedicated circuit in your brain and body

1165
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:12,500
for this particular pattern of breathing.

1166
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:15,820
We do it spontaneously, but you can do it intentionally

1167
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,100
and it works just as well, if not better,

1168
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:19,780
to regulate your levels of stress.

1169
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:21,580
That is to bring them down,

1170
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,740
which has outsized positive effects

1171
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:25,820
on your mood and mental health, not just in the moment,

1172
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,860
but it also should improve your confidence

1173
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,060
that when stress comes,

1174
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,300
because the world is filled with stressors, it's not if,

1175
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,940
it's when, when stress comes

1176
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,020
that you will have a physiologically,

1177
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:39,420
scientifically supported tool to deal with

1178
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,060
and reduce that stress.

1179
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,940
Now, in addition, I do believe it's important

1180
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,900
for sake of mood and mental health

1181
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:48,420
to also have a tool or a protocol

1182
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,500
to raise your stress threshold.

1183
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,220
That is to increase your capacity

1184
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,660
to deal with life stressors

1185
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,260
without them feeling so stressful.

1186
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,700
And there are a number of different ways to do this,

1187
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,140
but they all center around elevating your levels

1188
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,660
of adrenaline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine,

1189
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,420
noradrenaline, those are the same thing,

1190
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,100
just they have multiple names, forgive me.

1191
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,900
I didn't give the same two things four names,

1192
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,380
so don't blame me, blame the other scientists that did it.

1193
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,220
The point is, there are several ways

1194
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:17,780
that you can self-induce elevations

1195
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,220
of noradrenaline and adrenaline,

1196
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,180
and then to learn to anchor your mind

1197
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:25,620
and your thinking to stay calm

1198
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,540
in those elevated adrenaline states

1199
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,140
as a practice for when stressors hit you

1200
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,300
in the outside world

1201
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,940
and your adrenaline and noradrenaline spike.

1202
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:36,700
Now, one of the best ways to do this,

1203
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,940
because it works the first time and every time

1204
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,500
and is also zero cost, in fact, it will save you money,

1205
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:45,660
is to put yourself in a cold shower

1206
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,460
or other deliberate cold exposure environment,

1207
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,300
but most everyone has access to a cold shower,

1208
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:53,060
not everyone, but most people.

1209
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,820
And of course, by turning off the heat,

1210
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,740
you're going to reduce heating costs, right, your water bill.

1211
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:01,780
So getting into a cold shower for a minute or so

1212
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,220
to elevate your levels of adrenaline

1213
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,100
and learning to either use your breathing,

1214
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,900
you could do physiological size,

1215
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,620
or to distract yourself,

1216
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:10,940
or whatever tools and approaches you need

1217
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:13,300
to be able to stay calm

1218
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,500
while you have elevated levels of adrenaline in your body.

1219
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:19,020
And the reason deliberate cold exposure works so well

1220
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:22,860
to do this is that it is pretty non-negotiable.

1221
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,500
Even if you really love cold showers or cold plunges

1222
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,220
or things of that sort,

1223
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,060
you're still going to get that elevated adrenaline

1224
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:31,260
and noradrenaline.

1225
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,020
It's pretty much non-negotiable.

1226
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:35,340
For the first 10 or 15 seconds

1227
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,180
that you get into a cold plunge or a cold shower,

1228
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,860
you should fully expect yourself to feel stressed

1229
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,420
and for your breathing to accelerate.

1230
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,260
And then your goal is to try and anchor

1231
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,980
or control your breathing in that stressful environment.

1232
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:48,420
The reason for doing this is that it's a practice.

1233
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,420
It's a practice that's going to translate

1234
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:53,260
to a better ability to manage your internal state,

1235
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,500
and therefore your thinking, your cognition,

1236
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,460
and your ability to make good decisions under stress.

1237
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:02,180
It's not about becoming untouched by stress.

1238
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,260
It's about being able to better navigate stress.

1239
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,780
Indeed, I think of this as analogous to driving in fog,

1240
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,940
something that I had to learn to do

1241
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,140
because I grew up in the Bay Area

1242
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,340
and it can be very foggy there sometimes.

1243
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:15,340
And of course you don't learn to drive in fog

1244
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,700
the first day you learn how to drive,

1245
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:19,220
but the first time you hit heavy fog driving

1246
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,740
where you can only see one reflector

1247
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,740
in front of you at a time, it is truly stressful, right?

1248
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,860
You don't know if you're going to come up

1249
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,460
on another vehicle in an instant,

1250
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,780
which of course can happen.

1251
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,380
So you have to adjust a number of things.

1252
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,700
You have to learn how to do that.

1253
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,940
And while I would never elect to drive in fog,

1254
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,780
learning to drive in fog teaches you

1255
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,020
how to be comfortable driving

1256
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:39,100
in different weather environments.

1257
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,540
Same thing with driving in a rainstorm

1258
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,860
or for you East coasters from the Northeast,

1259
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,380
learning how to drive in a snowstorm.

1260
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,820
You would never elect to do that,

1261
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:46,980
but once you do it a few times,

1262
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,940
you feel more comfortable in those extreme conditions.

1263
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:52,180
So that's really what raising your stress threshold

1264
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,060
is all about.

1265
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,900
Of course, do it safely, do it under conditions

1266
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,020
in which you're not going to get hurt

1267
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,780
or anyone else will get hurt.

1268
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,060
But learning how to do this can be extremely beneficial.

1269
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,220
And of course, deliberate cold exposure isn't the only way,

1270
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,220
but frankly, it's the most reliable way

1271
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,460
and it's the most versatile way to do that

1272
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:09,780
because you can do it in your shower

1273
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,260
or in a cold plunge at home.

1274
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,860
So you can practice these things.

1275
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,260
Again, safety first,

1276
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:17,260
always make sure you're not exposing yourself to cold

1277
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,860
to the extent that you're going to damage yourself

1278
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,740
mentally or physically, but it's a great practice.

1279
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,940
And you could probably think of other ways

1280
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:25,500
to spike your adrenaline that was safe.

1281
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,140
And of course, life will spike your adrenaline.

1282
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:33,140
So you can also use real life as your stress inoculation tool

1283
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,100
and we all have to do that anyway.

1284
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,220
What I'm suggesting is that you adopt a real time tool,

1285
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,340
physiological size, and that you adopt

1286
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:43,220
at least one offline tool that you do anywhere from one

1287
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,140
to three, maybe seven days a week,

1288
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,820
but at least one day a week that you put yourself

1289
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,420
into a cold shower, deliberate cold exposure,

1290
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,860
not for sake of increasing metabolism or anything else,

1291
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,780
but really just to learn how to calm yourself

1292
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,140
and maintain clear cognition when stress hits

1293
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,660
because indeed stress is going to hit.

1294
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,180
So that's the big six for improving mood and mental health.

1295
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:07,460
And the big six apply, that is they are the cornerstone

1296
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,220
for mood and mental health, regardless of who you are,

1297
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,700
regardless of your age, regardless of whether or not

1298
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,220
you're dealing with an acute or a severe mood

1299
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,540
or mental health disorder, or you find yourself

1300
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,660
to be reasonably healthy with respect

1301
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,100
to mood and mental health.

1302
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:22,980
And you simply want your mood and mental health

1303
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,540
to be stable and or improve over time.

1304
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:30,060
Now, the reason why the big six, those six pillars

1305
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,220
are so important for mood and mental health

1306
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,100
and indeed form a critical component

1307
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,420
of what Dr. Paul Conti referred to

1308
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,300
as the first principles of self-care

1309
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:43,220
is that those six pillars establish a milieu

1310
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,260
that is an environment of neurochemicals,

1311
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,260
including neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin,

1312
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,980
epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine,

1313
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,380
and other neurochemicals as well, as well as hormones,

1314
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:58,460
testosterone, estrogen, prolactin, cortisol,

1315
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,820
and immune molecules and on and on

1316
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:05,420
that lead to a high degree of predictability

1317
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,300
in your brain and nervous system.

1318
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,380
Now, what do I mean by that?

1319
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,260
Why would predictability be such a key component

1320
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,580
of mood and mental health?

1321
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,420
Is it really just about knowing that you're going

1322
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:16,380
to feel energized in the early part of the day

1323
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,020
and tired at the end of the day?

1324
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,060
Now, that might be part of it,

1325
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,300
but that's not the major takeaway.

1326
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:24,620
The major takeaway is that as Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

1327
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:27,180
so aptly pointed out, your brain

1328
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,260
and indeed your entire nervous system

1329
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:31,180
has a couple of major jobs,

1330
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:33,020
has the job of regulating your breathing

1331
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,980
and your heart rate, et cetera.

1332
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:37,260
It also has the job of regulating your thinking

1333
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,940
and your planning and your memory.

1334
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,180
Those are the jobs of the brain and nervous system

1335
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:42,780
that we normally hear about.

1336
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,900
But if we think about the more macro jobs

1337
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:48,380
that the brain has, the key function of the brain,

1338
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,940
certainly the parts of the brain

1339
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,020
that are more recently evolved,

1340
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,620
the ones involved in thinking and planning, et cetera,

1341
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:57,740
are really involved in generating predictions,

1342
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,300
predictions about what's going to happen next

1343
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,220
and whether or not you're going to be prepared

1344
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,740
for what's going to happen next.

1345
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,060
And indeed, Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett

1346
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:08,420
also beautifully illustrated this model

1347
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,340
of the brain as regulating a brain-body budget

1348
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,980
and moods and a related topic, which she called affect.

1349
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,300
Okay, I'll explain what affect is in a moment.

1350
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,060
Setting the stage for being able to better predict

1351
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:24,620
what's going to happen next

1352
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:28,660
and therefore regulating your mood in the moment.

1353
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,620
Let's just take a moment and explore that statement

1354
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,300
in a little bit more detail.

1355
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,500
Essentially what she was saying

1356
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,420
and what I'm now again saying

1357
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:38,620
is that your brain and body go through different states.

1358
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:42,220
Your state at a given moment can be labeled as your affect.

1359
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,140
Your affect includes a lot of different things,

1360
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,580
including levels of autonomic arousal,

1361
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,580
levels of hormones, levels of trans mirrors,

1362
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,740
all of that stuff.

1363
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,660
But it falls under the umbrella of affect.

1364
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:57,500
Affect essentially sets the stage for particular emotions

1365
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,300
to be more likely or less likely to emerge.

1366
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,860
So emotion and affect aren't the same thing.

1367
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:04,620
Affect is a bit more general.

1368
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:07,180
It sort of undergirds the possibility

1369
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:09,540
of having certain moods like feeling elated,

1370
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:12,540
happy or sad or depressed.

1371
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,380
It really sets the general stage

1372
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,220
for different types of specific emotions,

1373
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,380
even highly specific emotions.

1374
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:22,980
So in that way, when you're taking care of the big six,

1375
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:26,380
when you're tending to these six pillars on a regular basis,

1376
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:28,780
and I should point out that we really want to tend

1377
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:31,060
to those six pillars every single day

1378
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,300
or every single 24 hours,

1379
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,820
we really need to make those a regular investment

1380
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,940
to the extent that we can.

1381
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:41,180
When we do that, we create a neurochemical

1382
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,500
and a neural milieu that allows the brain

1383
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,180
to be in a better predictive state.

1384
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:51,220
It allows the brain to give rise to certain affects,

1385
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,380
spelled A-F-F-E-C-T-S,

1386
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,340
so affects that lead to certain emotions

1387
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,260
being more or less likely to occur.

1388
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,020
Put very simply, when we're tending to those six pillars

1389
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:06,420
on a regular basis, we feel better more generally,

1390
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,060
and therefore the emotions that we tend to have

1391
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,060
under different conditions,

1392
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:13,260
even conditions of a difficult interaction

1393
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:15,460
with a coworker or with a family member,

1394
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,420
tend to be more positive than if we are not tending

1395
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,900
to those six pillars.

1396
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,580
Now, in some sense, that's sort of a duh statement.

1397
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:24,020
For instance, if you're sleep deprived,

1398
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:25,740
if you're not fed well,

1399
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,340
like you haven't eaten in a few hours,

1400
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:29,460
of course, you're going to be more irritable,

1401
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,740
you're going to be more reactive,

1402
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,460
you are going to be more emotionally labile.

1403
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,620
But sleep and nutrition

1404
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,180
are just two of those six core pillars.

1405
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,900
When we talk about those core pillars

1406
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,900
and the necessity for tending to them

1407
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,540
on a regular, every 24-hour basis,

1408
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:44,980
what we're really talking about

1409
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,500
is creating a milieu within our brain and nervous system

1410
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
that allows the nervous system to do what it does best,

1411
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,500
and in fact, what its main job is to do,

1412
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,620
which is to predict what's going to happen next.

1413
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,900
Because as Lisa Feldman Barrett pointed out,

1414
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,180
emotions are really context-dependent states

1415
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:05,220
that allow us to navigate not just our present circumstances,

1416
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,580
but they are our nervous system and brain's best guess

1417
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,300
about the circumstances that we are soon going to encounter.

1418
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,740
Now, I don't offer you all of that

1419
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,460
as kind of a bunch of a tangled mess of nerd speak

1420
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,300
to confuse you.

1421
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,140
What I'm saying is that by tending to those six core pillars,

1422
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:25,340
you are shifting the likely affects that you will experience

1423
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,980
and therefore the likely emotions that you will experience.

1424
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,540
So you're biasing your whole system

1425
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,420
towards more positive affect and more positive emotions,

1426
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,540
regardless of what your life circumstances happen to be

1427
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:38,500
and the stressors that you encounter.

1428
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,300
And indeed, you also are including

1429
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,700
that six pillar of stress control.

1430
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,540
So when those stressors arrive,

1431
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:47,100
you'll be better able to navigate them.

1432
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:49,380
Now, this view of emotion regulation,

1433
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:51,020
of mood and mental health,

1434
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,220
is certainly not a novel concept.

1435
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,820
People have talked about the physiological regulation of mood

1436
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,540
from the time of William James and even earlier.

1437
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,420
It's been a long-standing question, for instance,

1438
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,700
or debate in psychology and philosophy.

1439
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:06,140
Do we feel anxiety in our body and then label it as anxiety,

1440
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:09,620
or do we feel anxiety in our mind and then our body follows?

1441
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:10,900
That's been a long-standing debate

1442
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,380
and frankly, there's evidence on both sides,

1443
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,700
which leads me to the conclusion,

1444
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,700
I think most neurobiologists and psychologists

1445
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:19,220
to the conclusion that those things are interrelated

1446
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,020
in a way that we can't really dissociate them completely

1447
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,340
at any level, right?

1448
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,340
When your heart rate goes up

1449
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,140
and you start breathing faster,

1450
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,580
if I were to induce that state in you,

1451
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,620
you'd probably interpret that as feeling anxious.

1452
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,460
In addition to that,

1453
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:32,980
something can make you anxious

1454
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,740
before your heart rate and breathing increases

1455
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,180
and then your heart rate and breathing increases.

1456
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:38,340
So no need to tease those apart.

1457
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,140
But if you think about the brain,

1458
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,100
in large part as a prediction machine

1459
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,660
and your brain as a metabolic regulator,

1460
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,180
it's trying to decide which organs need resources.

1461
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,820
How much resource can I dedicate to thinking,

1462
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:53,300
to creativity, to enjoying social interaction,

1463
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,260
to paying attention to what somebody else is saying

1464
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:57,340
as opposed to what's going on inside my body?

1465
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,140
All of those major functions of the brain

1466
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:01,820
as they relate to affect and emotions

1467
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,940
are going to be best supported,

1468
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:06,900
that is biased toward positive mood,

1469
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,060
positive affect, positive emotions,

1470
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,300
and therefore positive mental health outcomes

1471
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,580
when we're tending to those six pillars.

1472
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,940
Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett referred to that whole process

1473
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,180
as the brain regulating a brain body budget.

1474
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,060
And she had beautiful analogies for that budget.

1475
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:24,860
And that's what led to the description

1476
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:27,940
of social interactions as either generating savings

1477
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:31,300
or being neutral or generating a taxed feeling,

1478
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,140
literally taxing that brain body budget.

1479
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:34,100
And I love that concept.

1480
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,700
And it's one that you can keep in mind.

1481
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,620
And indeed we can inject a lot of specificity

1482
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:41,780
into this whole process of improving mood and mental health

1483
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,380
through specific protocols.

1484
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,820
If you simply remember,

1485
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:49,140
if you make a daily investment in the six core pillars,

1486
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:51,860
you are building up that brain body budget.

1487
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:55,740
You will have more energetic resources to spend

1488
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,620
on whatever life circumstances come your way.

1489
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,500
Now, before we move into a discussion about protocols

1490
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,940
for how to better understand your life narrative

1491
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:06,700
to enhance your sense of self and confidence

1492
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,620
and things of that theme,

1493
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:11,300
I briefly want to mention that,

1494
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,940
of course there are known tools out there

1495
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:16,460
in the medical community and psychological community

1496
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,700
for improving mood and mental health.

1497
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,980
And while there are a variety of tools,

1498
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,940
one of the main tools of the psychiatrist

1499
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,780
is prescription drugs

1500
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,700
that target specific neuromodulator systems

1501
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,540
in the brain and body.

1502
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,580
For instance, SSRI,

1503
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,100
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

1504
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,820
or atypical antidepressants

1505
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:40,620
that target the dopamine and epinephrine systems

1506
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:42,660
such as wellbutrin, bupryorone

1507
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,580
or other types of antidepressants.

1508
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,460
Or for instance, nowadays there's a lot of growing excitement

1509
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:52,660
about clinical trials using relatively high dosages

1510
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,580
of psilocybin, which by the way,

1511
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,860
closely mimics the chemical serotonin.

1512
00:58:58,860 --> 00:58:59,940
That's right, psilocybin,

1513
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:03,060
which is converted to psilocin in the brain.

1514
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,260
If you look at it chemically,

1515
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,180
it looks very much like serotonin

1516
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:08,420
although it has distinct effects from serotonin.

1517
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,620
I talked about psilocybin

1518
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,860
and what's being done in terms of the clinical trials,

1519
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:13,660
safety considerations.

1520
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,860
I talked about the potential hazard considerations

1521
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,940
and where the legality and all of that is going

1522
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,220
in that episode if you want to check that out.

1523
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,820
But the reason I'm taking a moment to mention these drugs,

1524
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:26,060
things like SSRIs, Prozax, Olav, Citalopram,

1525
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,060
wellbutrin, psilocybin and so on

1526
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:33,180
is that all of them target specific neuromodulator systems

1527
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,580
in the brain and body.

1528
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,980
And at the same time, it's fairly clear

1529
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,980
that mood disorders such as major depression

1530
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,420
are not necessarily deficits

1531
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:45,180
in things like serotonin or dopamine.

1532
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:48,340
They can be, but most often they are not.

1533
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:52,220
So why are such drugs prescribed for mood disorders

1534
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,380
and for mental health disorders?

1535
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,860
Well, because if specific neuromodulators

1536
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,420
like serotonin, dopamine or epinephrine

1537
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,900
are dramatically increased above baseline,

1538
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,220
that affords the brain the ability to rewire itself.

1539
01:00:05,220 --> 01:00:08,060
Really the way to think about SSRIs

1540
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,300
or atypical antidepressants or psilocybin

1541
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,060
for the treatment of major depression

1542
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:18,300
is really to think about them as chemical tools

1543
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:21,260
to open or access neuroplasticity.

1544
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,060
And that's why it's oh so important

1545
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:25,500
that those drugs be combined with talk therapy

1546
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,020
where people are actively working through the sources,

1547
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,380
the real life sources and the historical sources,

1548
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,460
maybe even the trauma-based sources of their depression.

1549
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,660
And I mention this because there's a lot of debate nowadays

1550
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,140
as to whether or not these drugs are useful,

1551
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,140
whether or not the side effect profiles justify their use,

1552
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:46,900
whether or not they are applicable to young populations.

1553
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:48,180
There's a lot of debate about this.

1554
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,220
And certainly in the case of the psychedelics,

1555
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:53,140
there's a lot, a lot of debate

1556
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:55,420
because this is a newly emerging area

1557
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,860
and there's still not a lot of data,

1558
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,060
although it's starting to increase over time.

1559
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,460
But the key point here is that all of these drugs

1560
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,420
have the potential to work in some people, not others.

1561
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,500
Some people, they simply don't work for

1562
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,380
and they cause more problems than solutions they solve,

1563
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:17,220
but they tend to work by increasing the propensity

1564
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:21,540
for neuroplasticity by changing the neuromodulator milieu

1565
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:22,420
in the brain.

1566
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,740
And this is an important point when thinking about tools

1567
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,860
for enhancing mood and mental health,

1568
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,700
that when we think about tools

1569
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,620
for enhancing mood and mental health.

1570
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:33,540
And next, of course, we're going to talk about the tools

1571
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:38,140
that are specifically designed to target a specific aspect

1572
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:41,100
of one's life story or concept of self.

1573
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:45,260
All of that is always operating on a backdrop of two things,

1574
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,860
that overall neurochemical milieu and autonomic function

1575
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:50,860
that the six pillars relate to and support

1576
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,340
if we're attending to those,

1577
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,420
but any improvement in mood and mental health

1578
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,020
that's going to be significant, it's going to be noticeable

1579
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:58,300
and it's going to be stable,

1580
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,260
it's going to be pervasive over time,

1581
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,380
is going to require that some degree of neuroplasticity,

1582
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:06,020
some degree of neural rewiring occur.

1583
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:07,180
So I'm not bringing up the topic

1584
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:09,380
of these particular drug tools to say that

1585
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,740
they are the best way to improve mood and mental health.

1586
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:12,820
I'm certainly not saying that.

1587
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,740
They are, but one way to potentially improve

1588
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,980
mood and mental health.

1589
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:18,420
And if they are going to work,

1590
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,540
they always work best when done in concert

1591
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:22,380
with talk therapy,

1592
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:23,860
because they are opening the opportunity

1593
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,820
for neuroplasticity,

1594
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:27,540
but then that neuroplasticity has to be directed

1595
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,540
toward a particular endpoint.

1596
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:31,900
There has to be specific work that's being done

1597
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:35,180
by the individual or ideally the individual

1598
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:39,380
with an expert trained clinically certified therapist

1599
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:43,380
or psychologist or psychiatrist in order to make sure

1600
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,700
that the neuroplastic changes that occur

1601
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,460
lead to longstanding improvements

1602
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,060
in mood and mental health over time.

1603
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,380
Indeed, the drugs that I just described

1604
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:55,460
were originally designed as tools to allow people

1605
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,820
to access changes within their brain

1606
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:00,140
that would then allow them to enhance mood

1607
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:02,220
and mental health, but not have to rely

1608
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:05,620
on the drugs themselves for improved mood and mental health.

1609
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,620
And along those lines, I'm sure some of you out there

1610
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,900
are thinking about the supplement-based

1611
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:12,300
or nutrition-based approaches

1612
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,020
to enhancing these neuromodulators.

1613
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,540
And indeed, while they don't have the same potency

1614
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:18,540
as things like Wellbutrin and SSRIs

1615
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,180
at increasing things like dopamine

1616
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,860
and serotonin respectively,

1617
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,260
there is a growing number of people out there

1618
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,940
that are relying on daily supplementation

1619
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:29,260
with anywhere from one to three grams of L-tyrosine,

1620
01:03:29,260 --> 01:03:31,420
amino acid precursor to dopamine,

1621
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:36,180
combined with often 300 to 600 milligrams of alpha-GPC

1622
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:39,460
as a way to enhance dopamine and acetylcholine

1623
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:43,380
and to set the stage for elevated levels of neuroplasticity.

1624
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:45,420
But it's very important to point out

1625
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,620
that the amino acid precursors

1626
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,980
to the various neuromodulators like L-tyrosine,

1627
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:54,020
like L-tryptophan, so L-tyrosine precursor to dopamine,

1628
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:57,660
L-tryptophan precursor to serotonin, and so on,

1629
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:00,660
that those don't have the same degree of potency,

1630
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,180
that is ability to enhance those neuromodulators.

1631
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:06,260
And so the extent to which they enrich the possibility

1632
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,020
for neuroplasticity still remains somewhat obscure.

1633
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:11,620
There haven't been clinical trials on that yet,

1634
01:04:11,620 --> 01:04:14,300
at least not clinical trials that I am aware of.

1635
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,340
So I mentioned all of that stuff about drugs,

1636
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:17,540
whether or not it's psychedelics

1637
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,380
or whether or not it's prescription antidepressants

1638
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:21,340
or whether or not people are using

1639
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,900
a supplement-based amino acid-based protocol

1640
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:27,620
for increasing certain neuromodulators.

1641
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,420
I feel it was important to mention all of that because,

1642
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:32,060
well, first of all, it's quite prominent out there,

1643
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,260
certainly in the case of prescription antidepressants,

1644
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:36,340
and there's growing prominence

1645
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:39,620
and use of relatively high dose psilocybin.

1646
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:43,380
Again, always done with support talk therapy.

1647
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:46,340
This is done in a legal setting.

1648
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,140
I said legal, not illegal,

1649
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:51,060
a legal setting with a board-certified therapist.

1650
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,340
This is being done on university campuses,

1651
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,620
within research labs.

1652
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:56,300
And of course, I acknowledge that there are people

1653
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,180
who are using these compounds

1654
01:04:58,180 --> 01:04:59,700
outside the realm of the university

1655
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:01,260
clinical study environment.

1656
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,500
So I mentioned these chemicals,

1657
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:05,500
not because I'm pointing to them as the path

1658
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:07,700
to improved mood and mental health.

1659
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,500
They can be, but they aren't always,

1660
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,500
and as I mentioned before,

1661
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,300
they can sometimes cause problems

1662
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,540
that lead people to wish that they hadn't taken them

1663
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,740
or to decide to not take them any further,

1664
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:18,340
a decision that absolutely has to be made

1665
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:19,540
with a healthcare professional

1666
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:21,140
who's well certified to do that.

1667
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,900
But I'm mentioning these tools

1668
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,900
because I want you to understand if they work, why they work.

1669
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:30,220
And one key point that was really emphasized

1670
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:33,260
by Dr. Paul Conti, who, as I mentioned before,

1671
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,140
is a psychiatrist,

1672
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,980
so he uses pharmacology in his practice,

1673
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,260
although he uses other non-pharmacologic tools as well,

1674
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:42,460
is that these pharmacologic tools are never to be viewed

1675
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:45,460
as the be all end all of enhancing mood and mental health.

1676
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,860
They are but one path to improving mood and mental health

1677
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:51,300
and indeed should be viewed as a path

1678
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:54,260
to getting people who are otherwise unable to engage

1679
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,740
in those six core pillars,

1680
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,420
those first principles of mental health,

1681
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,980
to be able to do those things on a regular basis.

1682
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:04,420
And then perhaps, based on a discussion with their clinician,

1683
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:07,220
these people could come off those pharmacologic agents.

1684
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:08,300
Maybe yes, maybe no.

1685
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,540
It depends on the individual.

1686
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,300
It depends on the circumstances.

1687
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,860
But those core six pillars,

1688
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:15,220
those first principles of mental health

1689
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:19,580
that include but are not limited to those core six pillars

1690
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,660
are absolutely essential.

1691
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:25,420
There's no drug that can replace those core six pillars.

1692
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,540
I'd like to take a quick break

1693
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,940
and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.

1694
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,420
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

1695
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,100
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

1696
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:35,740
to help you better understand your body

1697
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,500
and help you reach your health goals.

1698
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:38,620
I've long been a believer

1699
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,260
in getting regular blood work done

1700
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,100
for the simple reason that many of the factors

1701
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,340
that impact your immediate and long-term health

1702
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:47,180
can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

1703
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:50,100
A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,

1704
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,860
is that you get information back about metabolic factors,

1705
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,540
lipids and hormones and so forth,

1706
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:56,580
but you don't know what to do with that information.

1707
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,780
With InsideTracker, they make it very easy

1708
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,700
because they have a personalized platform

1709
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:03,260
that allows you to see the levels of all those things,

1710
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:05,780
metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,

1711
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:08,660
but it gives you specific directives that you can follow

1712
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,980
that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,

1713
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,260
supplements, et cetera,

1714
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:14,540
that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges

1715
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,900
that are optimal for you.

1716
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,300
If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

1717
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,580
you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

1718
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,220
to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

1719
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:26,660
Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman.

1720
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,900
Okay, so setting aside the core six pillars,

1721
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:32,140
let's now talk about other tools for mood and mental health

1722
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:36,180
that center around really what we more typically think of

1723
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:39,980
when we think of mood and mental health, which is emotions.

1724
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,900
When Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett was a guest on the podcast,

1725
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,740
she said something that was really incredible,

1726
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:47,980
and it's something that's strongly grounded

1727
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,340
in excellent scientific data,

1728
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:52,900
which is the more specificity that we can put

1729
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,220
to labeling our emotions,

1730
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:56,700
the better off we're going to be

1731
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,780
in terms of our overall mental health.

1732
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:01,060
Let me restate that.

1733
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,380
The more specific language that we can put

1734
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,860
to our own internal emotions,

1735
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:09,060
even if that language is just to ourselves

1736
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:10,260
in our own internal narrative,

1737
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:13,860
we don't even have to speak out what those labels are,

1738
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,300
the better that we're going to feel over time.

1739
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:20,340
And indeed, this effect can be quite rapid.

1740
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,740
And indeed, Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett has done research

1741
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,460
on this very specific topic.

1742
01:08:24,460 --> 01:08:27,940
It's something that's referred to as emotional granularity.

1743
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:31,020
So while some of us move through life

1744
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,300
with a sort of what I call emojification of emotions,

1745
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,820
you know, you got your happy face, happy,

1746
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:40,540
your sad face, sad, you know, you're angry, depressed,

1747
01:08:40,540 --> 01:08:44,340
anxious, you know, those are labels for emotional states,

1748
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,460
or you could think of them as affects or emotions.

1749
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:49,100
I think of them as emotions, but they're not very specific.

1750
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:50,580
They're pretty broad bins.

1751
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:53,900
We say sad or depressed or super depressed

1752
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:56,300
or super sad, anxious, panic.

1753
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:57,700
And when we think of that as nuance,

1754
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,660
but it's not very nuanced.

1755
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:02,140
And Lisa's laboratory and other laboratories

1756
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:04,300
have explored two things.

1757
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:06,260
First, if people are asked to or encouraged

1758
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,940
to put more granularity, more specificity

1759
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:10,460
on what they're feeling,

1760
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,100
then it seems that their levels of emotional processing

1761
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,420
are better overall.

1762
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:15,980
How does that translate to emotions?

1763
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:20,980
Well, it translates to better overall feelings of wellbeing

1764
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:26,540
when one is placing more specificity on positive emotions.

1765
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,220
And the flip side is also true.

1766
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:30,580
So this is important to know.

1767
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:34,180
If one places more specificity on negative emotions,

1768
01:09:34,180 --> 01:09:37,620
it also can enhance one's kind of experience

1769
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,460
of those negative emotions.

1770
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:42,780
Now, that means that this is a two-sided blade, all right?

1771
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,380
This isn't always a good thing.

1772
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,100
And if one is thinking about protocols

1773
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:48,100
for improving mood and mental health,

1774
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:52,620
the data make very clear that adding more specificity

1775
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,540
to our positive emotions in terms of the language we use,

1776
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:58,060
but also just the depth with which we process

1777
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:00,060
and think about those positive experiences

1778
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:02,060
can be very beneficial for us.

1779
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:03,820
So there are two studies that I'd like to highlight

1780
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,100
that relate to this.

1781
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,460
The first is entitled Effective Self-Monitoring

1782
01:10:07,460 --> 01:10:08,700
Through Experience Sampling

1783
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:12,420
on Emotion Differentiation in Depression.

1784
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,380
And the second study is entitled

1785
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:16,060
Emotional Granularity Increases

1786
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:18,860
with Intensive Ambulatory Assessment.

1787
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:22,420
Methodological and individual factors influence how much.

1788
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:24,140
Now, each of these studies focus

1789
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:25,140
on something slightly different.

1790
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:26,420
The first study was mainly focused

1791
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,180
on people who have depression,

1792
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:32,260
and they were cued several, if not many times per day,

1793
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:36,100
to just think about and report on their emotional state.

1794
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:38,340
And that was done in order to get people

1795
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:40,260
to place more granularity,

1796
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:42,020
more specificity on what they're feeling,

1797
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,460
but also simply to tap into how they're feeling

1798
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,540
on a more regular basis throughout the day.

1799
01:10:46,540 --> 01:10:48,540
The second study, which is one that included

1800
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,980
Dr. Lisa Feldman-Behr as an author,

1801
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,180
was slightly different because it focused

1802
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,180
on non-depressed individuals,

1803
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,940
and it cued them to touch into their emotions

1804
01:10:56,940 --> 01:10:58,020
more times per day,

1805
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,420
and it also included some physiological measurements.

1806
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,500
And one in particular that we're going to talk about

1807
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,580
in some detail.

1808
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:07,180
Now, I don't have time to go into all the details

1809
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:08,020
of these studies.

1810
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,900
I may do that in a future podcast episode,

1811
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:11,500
but the key takeaways are very important

1812
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,220
for all of us to know, which are, first of all,

1813
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:18,260
the more often that you can ask yourself,

1814
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:20,340
what am I really feeling right now?

1815
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,980
How do I feel?

1816
01:11:21,980 --> 01:11:24,100
And, and this is so critical,

1817
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:29,620
the more that you force yourself to not use broad labels

1818
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:31,980
or simply valence labels.

1819
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:35,700
Valence labels are good or okay or bad.

1820
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:40,220
And instead, understand that good is not an emotion.

1821
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,860
Okay is not an emotion.

1822
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:43,380
Bad is not an emotion.

1823
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,860
But rather saying, you know, I feel, you know,

1824
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:47,820
curious but a little anxious,

1825
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:48,940
if that happens to be the case.

1826
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:51,900
Or I feel, you know, bored,

1827
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,980
but, you know, also a little bit in positive anticipation

1828
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:57,420
about what's going to happen tomorrow.

1829
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:58,240
Things of that sort,

1830
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,560
putting more nuance and specificity on your emotions,

1831
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,200
but also touching into or thinking

1832
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,160
about your own emotional states more times per day,

1833
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,240
clearly has positive outcomes for mood and mental health.

1834
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:13,440
And the reasons for that are incredibly interesting.

1835
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,760
And this is something everybody should understand.

1836
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,240
Why would it be that putting more specificity

1837
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:19,280
on what we're feeling?

1838
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:21,240
So perhaps just in our own heads,

1839
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,720
like thinking, okay, how do I feel right now?

1840
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:24,720
Like if I were to do that right now,

1841
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:27,320
I'd say I feel energized

1842
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:29,320
and happy.

1843
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:31,120
I do, I really enjoy doing what I'm doing.

1844
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:35,200
So I wouldn't say I'm like off the charts in awe

1845
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,480
or elation, but I'm very happy and I feel energized.

1846
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:39,320
You know, earlier today,

1847
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,940
I was feeling a little bit fatigued

1848
01:12:41,940 --> 01:12:43,880
and a little bit confused

1849
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,320
because I was trying to sort out something

1850
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:47,920
and it wasn't making sense to me.

1851
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,160
So assessments like that,

1852
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:52,140
which can be told to somebody else

1853
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:54,140
or that we just hold internally,

1854
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,640
done repeatedly throughout the day,

1855
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:58,000
anywhere from three to six times throughout the day,

1856
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,840
just periodically pinging ourselves.

1857
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:00,900
Maybe you set an alarm

1858
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,760
or maybe you just decide to every once in a while,

1859
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,840
maybe every time you go into an elevator

1860
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,160
or every time you go up a flight of stairs,

1861
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,640
you just ask yourself, yeah, how do I feel right now?

1862
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,480
And thinking about that for a moment.

1863
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:12,840
And you don't have to write it down,

1864
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:14,320
although I suppose you could.

1865
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,840
What turns out that just that practice

1866
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:19,840
can really enhance our so-called emotional granularity

1867
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,680
that can enhance our positive emotions and affect.

1868
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,760
And in addition, it provides us a better sensitivity

1869
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,640
to better understand those negative emotions,

1870
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:32,660
which sounds like it might be a bad thing,

1871
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:35,560
but those negative emotions have information in them.

1872
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,200
Right, this is one thing that's often lost

1873
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,280
in those broad categorizations of anxious

1874
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,800
or sad or depressed.

1875
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:42,640
And keep in mind, of course,

1876
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,640
that some people are genuinely clinically depressed

1877
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,360
and that needs to be taken extremely seriously,

1878
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,280
just like some people are genuinely clinically anxious

1879
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:51,280
and that needs to be taken seriously.

1880
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:54,560
But most of us, when we throw out the words depressed,

1881
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,360
angry, sad, we're not using enough nuance

1882
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,960
and it doesn't really apply to our internal states

1883
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,480
or the circumstances that we're in.

1884
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,960
And as a consequence, we suffer.

1885
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,920
It's not just about communicating our emotions,

1886
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,800
we suffer because the data say that the more nuance,

1887
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,640
the more emotional granularity that we have,

1888
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:16,320
the richer is our experience of the positive aspects of life

1889
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:20,580
and the more effectively we can navigate

1890
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:23,320
the negative aspects of life, right?

1891
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:26,100
Again, negative emotions perhaps isn't the best way

1892
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,440
to even describe negative emotions

1893
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:30,980
because that label negative implies that we should avoid it.

1894
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:32,540
And in fact, those negative emotions

1895
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:35,580
provide a lot of information about perhaps

1896
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,620
social interactions that we should seek to avoid

1897
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:39,980
in the future and so on and so forth.

1898
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,500
Now, one of the most interesting things

1899
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:45,820
about this whole process of increasing emotional granularity

1900
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:47,340
and touching in several times per day

1901
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:50,420
into how we feel, something that's completely zero cost,

1902
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,060
takes just a moment to do,

1903
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:53,740
that we can get much better at over time.

1904
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:55,320
That was clearly seen in these studies

1905
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,980
that people get much better at doing this.

1906
01:14:56,980 --> 01:15:00,060
It becomes more facile for them very quickly

1907
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:02,860
is that it correlates with improvements

1908
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:05,700
in physiological metrics that relate

1909
01:15:05,700 --> 01:15:08,660
to overall improvements in mood and mental health.

1910
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:12,180
And the specific physiological metric that I'm referring to

1911
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:14,420
is so-called vagal tone.

1912
01:15:14,420 --> 01:15:17,380
Some of you have perhaps heard of the vagus nerve.

1913
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,640
It's the 10th cranial nerve.

1914
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:20,600
It's an extensive peripheral nerve

1915
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:25,320
that it goes out of the brain at the level of the neck.

1916
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,720
It's one of the cranial nerves that extends

1917
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,800
to essentially all the organs of the body,

1918
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:32,200
the heart, the lungs, et cetera, but it's a two-way street.

1919
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:34,100
It's a superhighway of nerves out of the brain

1920
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,360
and into the body, and it's a superhighway of nerves

1921
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,560
back from the bodily organs to the brain.

1922
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,520
And it's involved in regulating a lot of

1923
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:44,920
so-called autonomic functions.

1924
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,680
So how fast our heart rate is,

1925
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,280
how fast our breathing is, rates of digestion.

1926
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,240
And all of that weaves together to create those things

1927
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:55,400
that we call affect our internal states.

1928
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,720
So without going into a ton of detail about the vagus nerve,

1929
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:02,160
there's something that's called cardiac vagal control.

1930
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,660
Cardiac vagal control is the extent to which

1931
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:07,880
that vagus nerve can impact your heart rate

1932
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:12,000
and your overall feelings of calm or alertness.

1933
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,440
Now, the simple way to think about this

1934
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,840
is more commonly referred to as heart rate variability.

1935
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,920
Heart rate variability is simply the distance

1936
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:20,900
between your heartbeats,

1937
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,340
or rather the time between your heartbeats,

1938
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:26,880
which we know if those timings between your heartbeats

1939
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,600
are somewhat variable,

1940
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,940
that is correlated with positive physical

1941
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:33,880
and mental health outcomes.

1942
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,020
One of the ways that you can increase heart rate variability

1943
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:39,200
is to get regular cardiovascular exercise,

1944
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,120
as well as doing resistance exercise,

1945
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:44,320
and no surprise, getting sufficient amounts

1946
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,480
of quality sleep each night is also going to be

1947
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,380
very beneficial for heart rate variability.

1948
01:16:49,380 --> 01:16:51,900
Now, exercise and sleep, of course, are wonderful,

1949
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:55,100
but it turns out that there's also a very rapid way

1950
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,080
to increase heart rate variability

1951
01:16:57,080 --> 01:17:00,840
by activating the vagal innervation of the heart

1952
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,940
and the way that the heart and some other circuits

1953
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,080
within the so-called brainstem interact.

1954
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,280
And that's through something called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

1955
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:14,200
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia can be summarized very simply

1956
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:19,000
by saying when you inhale, you speed your heart rate up,

1957
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:23,080
and when you exhale, you slow your heart rate down.

1958
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,920
And it's that exhale, slowing your heart rate down

1959
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,280
that's mediated by the vagus nerve.

1960
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,680
Now, there's a more thorough description of that,

1961
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:33,200
which I'll just give you now, and it's not that lengthy.

1962
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:34,860
So here's how it goes.

1963
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:39,840
When you inhale, your diaphragm actually moves down,

1964
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,580
and as a consequence, your heart actually gets a little bigger,

1965
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,120
has a little more space.

1966
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,880
As a consequence, the fluid in your heart

1967
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,600
moves a little more slowly per unit volume,

1968
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,040
and there's a neural signal to speed the heart up.

1969
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,020
Conversely, when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.

1970
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,280
That means there's a little less space for the heart

1971
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,000
in the general area where it's sitting,

1972
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,120
so the heart gets a little bit smaller,

1973
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,080
a little more compact.

1974
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:03,720
That means that the fluid in your heart

1975
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,760
is moving more quickly through that smaller space,

1976
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,160
and there's a neural signal mediated by the vagus

1977
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:10,920
to slow the heart down.

1978
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:12,940
So that's why inhale, speed your heart up,

1979
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:15,460
and exhales, slow your heart down.

1980
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:18,200
That is the basis of so-called RSA,

1981
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,840
or respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

1982
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,420
Now, what does any of that have to do

1983
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:25,400
with the granularity of language

1984
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,040
that we place on our emotions?

1985
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,320
Turns out there's several studies showing

1986
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:35,080
that when people place more descriptive granularity

1987
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,700
on their emotions, that is correlated with, okay?

1988
01:18:37,700 --> 01:18:41,020
It's not causal, but it's correlated with improvements

1989
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:43,060
in respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

1990
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,980
which we know correlate with improvements

1991
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:46,460
in heart rate variability.

1992
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,620
Indeed, it's one of the major bases

1993
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:50,020
for heart rate variability,

1994
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,620
which we know is correlated

1995
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:54,780
with not just positive physical health outcomes,

1996
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,820
but positive mental health outcomes,

1997
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,540
including lower levels of anxiety, improved sleep,

1998
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:01,240
and overall levels of mood.

1999
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:03,520
This is a topic that I'm very familiar with,

2000
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:05,620
because last year, my laboratory

2001
01:19:05,620 --> 01:19:07,260
at Stanford University School of Medicine

2002
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:09,200
in collaboration with a colleague of mine,

2003
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,620
Dr. David Spiegel, our Associate Chair of Psychiatry,

2004
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:15,020
also at Stanford University School of Medicine,

2005
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,080
published a clinical trial in Cell Reports Medicine,

2006
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,420
showing that there's a particular pattern of breathing

2007
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:25,120
that people can do for just five minutes per day

2008
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,540
that is effective in significantly improving

2009
01:19:28,540 --> 01:19:33,540
various metrics related to mood, and reducing anxiety,

2010
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,940
and also improving sleep.

2011
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:38,740
Although I should say the protocol I'm about to describe

2012
01:19:38,740 --> 01:19:42,460
didn't uniformly improve all of those metrics.

2013
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:44,540
It had a bigger effect on some versus others.

2014
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:47,260
I'll provide a link to that study in the show note captions.

2015
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,620
But if you're wondering what this protocol is

2016
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,240
that people did for five minutes a day

2017
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,820
that allowed them to, by the way,

2018
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:54,580
pervasively improve their mood.

2019
01:19:54,580 --> 01:19:55,740
So it wasn't just their mood

2020
01:19:55,740 --> 01:19:58,300
while they were doing this five minute a day protocol.

2021
01:19:58,300 --> 01:20:02,260
It was improvements in mood around the clock, essentially,

2022
01:20:02,260 --> 01:20:04,640
as well as improvements in other physiological metrics

2023
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,640
and other aspects of those six core pillars.

2024
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:11,560
It was that physiological sigh that we talked about earlier.

2025
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:12,520
Although in this case,

2026
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,160
we didn't have people do just one physiological sigh.

2027
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,740
We had people set aside five minutes per day.

2028
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,320
So set a timer for five minutes.

2029
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:20,800
They could sit or lie down.

2030
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,860
They could do it any time of day.

2031
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,100
And we just had them repeat that physiological sigh

2032
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,360
for a duration of five minutes total

2033
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,440
so that they would do two inhales through the nose,

2034
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:35,200
and then a full exhale to lungs empty through the mouth.

2035
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,840
Then they would do it again,

2036
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:37,860
and then they would do it again.

2037
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,320
And again, until those five minutes were completed.

2038
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,660
Again, the outcome of that clinical trial

2039
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:45,520
was that that particular pattern of breathing,

2040
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,920
which we called cyclic physiological sighing

2041
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,680
for five minutes per day,

2042
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:51,880
again, done any time of day,

2043
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,240
had the most positive outcomes

2044
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:56,520
in terms of improving mood and mental health

2045
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,660
and autonomic function,

2046
01:20:57,660 --> 01:21:00,560
those things related to sleep and heart rate variability.

2047
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,140
So that's a very simple, very minimal time investment,

2048
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,820
zero cost tool that anyone can use

2049
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:10,200
that again improves various metrics of physical health,

2050
01:21:10,200 --> 01:21:12,640
but also improves metrics of mental health.

2051
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:16,320
And it ties right back in with what was observed

2052
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,480
in the work by Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

2053
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:24,260
exploring how putting more word label,

2054
01:21:24,260 --> 01:21:27,400
emotional granularity on one's emotional states

2055
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,680
positively impact our physiological state.

2056
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,400
And the fact that thinking about our emotions

2057
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,240
more frequently throughout the day

2058
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:37,120
and deliberately putting more label granularity

2059
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,720
on those emotions frequently throughout the day

2060
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,800
is correlated with this improvement

2061
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,480
in respiratory sinus arrhythmia and heart rate variability.

2062
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,400
The fact that these things all relate to one another

2063
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,520
should not surprise us because indeed

2064
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,080
there's a previous paper,

2065
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,040
this is a quite extensive review.

2066
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,980
Actually, it's a very nice review.

2067
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:57,800
It's one that I encourage anyone who's interested

2068
01:21:57,800 --> 01:21:59,320
in these topics to explore,

2069
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:01,920
especially psychologists who might have a interest

2070
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,720
in physiology or psychiatrists

2071
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:07,040
or simply people who are interested in mind-body stuff.

2072
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:09,200
This is a review published in 2017

2073
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:11,080
in the journal, Biological Psychology,

2074
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:13,180
entitled Cardiac Vagal Control

2075
01:22:13,180 --> 01:22:15,920
as a Marker of Emotion Regulation in Healthy Adults,

2076
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:16,760
a review.

2077
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:19,900
And again, it's a really wonderful literature review

2078
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,280
of the peer-reviewed primary research,

2079
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:26,500
which really establishes that this thing, vagal tone,

2080
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,120
our ability to kind of put the brakes

2081
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:30,380
on our autonomic nervous system

2082
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,380
and slow our heart rate down deliberately

2083
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:33,380
through our breathing,

2084
01:22:33,380 --> 01:22:36,100
and perhaps even just by stopping and reflecting

2085
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,300
on what our emotional states are

2086
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,860
is really beneficial for our overall mood

2087
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,700
and mental health.

2088
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:43,340
And I want to highlight, bold,

2089
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:45,980
and underline that word overall,

2090
01:22:45,980 --> 01:22:47,140
because it's not just the case

2091
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:49,560
that people experience elevated mood and mental health

2092
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:50,940
in the moments where they stop and go,

2093
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,140
oh, how am I feeling?

2094
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:55,980
Oh, you know, am I feeling bored or agitated?

2095
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,180
Do I feel particularly excited?

2096
01:22:58,180 --> 01:23:02,180
Sure, that can have some impact on physiological metrics

2097
01:23:02,180 --> 01:23:03,300
and mood and mental health,

2098
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,260
but in all of these studies,

2099
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:08,260
the outcome seems to be that people's overall levels

2100
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,960
of mood and mental health are enhanced,

2101
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,100
not just while they're thinking about their emotions

2102
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:14,700
or doing this five-minute-a-day cyclic sighing,

2103
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:17,020
but around the clock, which is really terrific

2104
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:18,920
because I think that's what most all of us want,

2105
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:20,880
which is improved mood and mental health,

2106
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:23,380
not just in the moments when we do a practice

2107
01:23:23,380 --> 01:23:24,740
or in the few minutes afterwards,

2108
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:27,100
but 24 hours a day.

2109
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,140
I suppose we might segment out sleep

2110
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:31,100
during which, you know, hopefully we're having great dreams

2111
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,120
as opposed to other kinds of dreams.

2112
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:37,260
But the point is everyone, I have to imagine,

2113
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:38,620
would like to feel better

2114
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:40,700
and have elevated mood and mental health

2115
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,140
during the times when they're awake.

2116
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:44,460
And indeed, these sorts of protocols

2117
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,760
have been shown to do that,

2118
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,860
or so say the scientific data.

2119
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:49,540
Now we are going to discuss the tools

2120
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:51,660
for enhancing mood and mental health

2121
01:23:51,660 --> 01:23:53,640
gleaned from the four-episode guest series

2122
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,180
with Dr. Paul Conti,

2123
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,440
who is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry.

2124
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:01,240
He also has particular expertise in trauma.

2125
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:02,860
However, the four-episode guest series

2126
01:24:02,860 --> 01:24:04,360
that we did with Dr. Conti

2127
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:06,840
was really about exploring the self,

2128
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,160
as well as tools and protocols

2129
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:12,120
for not just gaining a better understanding of oneself,

2130
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:14,000
but also for gaining a better understanding

2131
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,160
and tools for relating to others, AKA relationships.

2132
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:20,440
Thread through the series was a model of the mind

2133
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,700
and how it works to create everything

2134
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:25,660
from feelings, thoughts, to behaviors

2135
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:28,900
that Dr. Paul Conti described as an iceberg model.

2136
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,000
And I perhaps should refer you to the fact

2137
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,220
that he actually drew out this model

2138
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,760
and we provided it as a zero-cost PDF

2139
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:36,880
in the show note captions

2140
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:38,900
for every single one of those episodes

2141
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:40,740
in that four-episode series.

2142
01:24:40,740 --> 01:24:42,980
We also provide a link to this model

2143
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:46,060
in the show note captions for this tools episode.

2144
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,860
The model is called the iceberg model.

2145
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:50,620
And as the name suggests, it resembles an iceberg

2146
01:24:50,620 --> 01:24:54,380
in which the vast majority of our mind's processing

2147
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:58,080
occurs below our conscious awareness in our unconscious mind.

2148
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,420
So that's the portion of the iceberg

2149
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,360
that resides below the surface.

2150
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:03,180
Whereas the portion of our mental processing

2151
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:06,800
that we are aware of resides above the water surface,

2152
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,260
the so-called conscious mind.

2153
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:10,140
So a key aspect of the iceberg model

2154
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:12,840
is that the unconscious mind is responsible

2155
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:15,540
for the vast majority of our feelings,

2156
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:16,960
thoughts, and behaviors,

2157
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,280
but that we are not aware

2158
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,760
of how this unconscious mind is doing that.

2159
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,160
And by extension, the tools and protocols

2160
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:24,760
that Dr. Conti described,

2161
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:27,880
largely deal with going into the unconscious

2162
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:30,200
and figuring out how the unconscious processing

2163
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,540
is influencing our conscious processing,

2164
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:34,960
both in healthy and in unhealthy ways.

2165
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,620
And when we say in healthy and unhealthy ways,

2166
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:40,880
we're largely referring to the presence of defenses.

2167
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,120
So some of you have perhaps heard of defenses before.

2168
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:45,280
Some defenses can indeed be healthy

2169
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:46,960
and others are unhealthy.

2170
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:51,840
There are defenses such as projection, sublimation, denial.

2171
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:53,680
And during the course of that four episode series,

2172
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,800
Dr. Conti explains how projections

2173
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,040
are not always bad for us.

2174
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:01,680
Indeed, they can protect us from panic, from severe trauma,

2175
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:04,180
but they also can create difficulties

2176
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:06,760
in processing our own understanding of self

2177
01:26:06,760 --> 01:26:08,040
and of our life experiences

2178
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:10,680
in ways that can actually be damaging to us.

2179
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:13,380
So a key takeaway from that four episode series

2180
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:15,520
is to understand and acknowledge

2181
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,600
that your unconscious mind is driving

2182
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,080
much of what you feel, think and do.

2183
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,480
However, by doing structured exploration of the self,

2184
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,320
and we'll talk about how to do that,

2185
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,000
one can gain better understanding

2186
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,840
of how that unconscious processing

2187
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:32,960
is influencing what you think, feel, believe and do.

2188
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,080
So once you accept the important role of the unconscious mind

2189
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,640
and you make the decision that you want

2190
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,840
to better understand how your unconscious mind

2191
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:42,200
and conscious mind are in this constant dialogue

2192
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,120
and how you can have that dialogue better serve you,

2193
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,120
there are a series of actionable tools that you can do

2194
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:51,080
that will allow you to better understand yourself

2195
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,640
and how you relate to others.

2196
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,040
And the first of these tools

2197
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,080
is to really understand your self concept.

2198
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,200
Now, of course, most all of us know our own name.

2199
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:02,120
Rarely do we ever forget that name.

2200
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,920
We have some concept of where we're from,

2201
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:07,660
who our parents are, what our present and future goals

2202
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,180
might be, where we've succeeded,

2203
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,620
where we failed in life and on and on.

2204
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:13,480
But the self concept goes far beyond

2205
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:17,680
that sort of CV list or our biography of self.

2206
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,920
Indeed, the self concept has a lot to do

2207
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:23,880
with our self confidence, our feelings of ability,

2208
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:26,040
both to overcome challenges,

2209
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:29,000
but also our ability to serve the world that we're in

2210
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,600
and our ability to change ourselves over time.

2211
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,600
Now, of course, the degree to which somebody

2212
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,080
might have confidence or less confidence

2213
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,480
or the degree to which somebody feels

2214
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:39,880
that they can exert influence on their environment

2215
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:42,320
and their goals is of course going to vary

2216
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,300
based on their personal history.

2217
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:48,160
But as Dr. Conti explained, even independent of all that,

2218
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,040
if one puts in some work to better understand

2219
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:53,920
their self concept, to really get a clear picture

2220
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:57,800
of one's self, from that one can develop more agency

2221
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,440
with which to pursue one's aspirations

2222
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:02,000
and to reach their goals.

2223
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,840
And the key concept here is one that's particularly powerful

2224
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,660
for both exploring and building up one's concept of self.

2225
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,960
And that's to consciously and deliberately build

2226
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,160
a life narrative.

2227
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:15,940
Now, a simple way to do this that can be very effective

2228
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:19,500
is to create a series of folders or documents.

2229
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,240
It could even be a stack of papers.

2230
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:23,560
I prefer to do this in electronic form.

2231
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:26,000
And I confess that even before learning about this tool

2232
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:29,160
from Dr. Conti, I had initiated doing this tool

2233
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:31,400
starting back in 2015.

2234
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,240
And it's fairly straightforward, but as I mentioned before,

2235
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,640
it can be very powerful.

2236
01:28:35,640 --> 01:28:39,280
And it simply consists of building out separate folders

2237
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,840
or pieces of paper, and this could be done electronically

2238
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,400
or on real world paper with paper and pen

2239
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,480
or paper and pencil.

2240
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:48,120
And essentially what you do is you're going to divide

2241
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:51,800
your life history into some regular increments.

2242
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,320
So for me, the way that I did this is I created a folder

2243
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:57,760
on my laptop that I actually call Lifetime.

2244
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,100
So that's the title of the main folder.

2245
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,480
And then within that folder, I have a series of folders,

2246
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,720
each of which spans a particular phase of my life.

2247
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:08,080
So zero to five years of age, six to 10 years of age,

2248
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:11,200
11 to 15 years of age, and so on and so forth.

2249
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,240
Now I'm 48 years old, so I have folders that extend

2250
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,560
to age 50 currently, although I will add folders

2251
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,080
going forward very soon.

2252
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,760
And the idea here is that for each of those folders,

2253
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:24,080
you're going to place a single word document

2254
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:25,200
into that folder.

2255
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:28,760
And then on that word document, you're not going to journal,

2256
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:31,480
you're not going to do any sort of extensive writing,

2257
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:35,600
rather you're simply going to put down bullet points

2258
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,740
with titles, it could be one or two sentences,

2259
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,080
but typically it's just a few words describing

2260
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:42,940
some of the key milestone events that you remember

2261
01:29:42,940 --> 01:29:45,040
from that particular phase of your life.

2262
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,920
So just for sake of example, I'll read off some

2263
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,200
of the things that are included in the folders

2264
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:51,780
for my particular lifetime narrative.

2265
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:54,160
But of course, this relates to my lifetime narrative,

2266
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:56,160
you should of course, put the milestones

2267
01:29:56,160 --> 01:29:58,920
and key bullet points that relate to your lifetime narrative.

2268
01:29:58,920 --> 01:30:00,800
But again, just to give you a sense of the sorts of things

2269
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:02,720
that made it into this folder,

2270
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:07,080
in my six years old to 11 year old folder,

2271
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:09,900
on that document, I put where I was living at that time,

2272
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:12,140
the city I was living, the school that I went to,

2273
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,660
I put a couple of teachers names,

2274
01:30:14,660 --> 01:30:17,220
teachers that had a particular influence on me,

2275
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:19,580
a particular summer camp experience,

2276
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,620
that was not a traumatic experience by the way,

2277
01:30:21,620 --> 01:30:23,600
it was a happy experience, but for me,

2278
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,960
it turned out to be a very transformative one.

2279
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:27,980
And then there were a couple other things in there

2280
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:31,500
that are just recollections of childhood friends names.

2281
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:34,180
So seemingly mundane information perhaps,

2282
01:30:34,180 --> 01:30:36,520
but it looks more or less like a biography

2283
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,140
and yet other folders.

2284
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:42,180
So for instance, the folder that spans from 25

2285
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:44,940
to 30 years of age is the time that I was

2286
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:47,140
in graduate school, so it includes a note

2287
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,340
about graduate school, a note about particular hobbies

2288
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:50,620
that I was interested in,

2289
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:52,820
in addition to my scientific research at the time,

2290
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:54,300
a couple of key relationships,

2291
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,540
a couple of key relationship challenges,

2292
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,580
as well as some things that at that time,

2293
01:30:58,580 --> 01:31:00,700
I was processing about prior years,

2294
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:03,340
in particular my teen years in high school.

2295
01:31:03,340 --> 01:31:05,220
Now, the key thing here is that whatever goes

2296
01:31:05,220 --> 01:31:07,660
into these folders is what's important to you.

2297
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:10,500
It could be positive events, it could be negative events.

2298
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,440
It could be events that for whatever reason you remember

2299
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:15,560
and that keep surfacing in your mind

2300
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,620
that you think might be interesting or important

2301
01:31:17,620 --> 01:31:19,580
at some later time or that you're concerned

2302
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:20,420
you might forget.

2303
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:22,100
In fact, that might be a really good metric

2304
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:23,740
for whether or not you include something

2305
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:24,940
in these folders or not.

2306
01:31:24,940 --> 01:31:26,520
If there's something that you want to make sure

2307
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:29,900
that you never forget, but that you think you might forget,

2308
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,020
I would encourage you to put it onto that word document

2309
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:34,020
and put it into that particular folder.

2310
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:37,780
Again, this isn't about creating a coherent life story.

2311
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:40,460
This is about creating a series of segments

2312
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:43,500
of small collections of key life events,

2313
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,260
positive, negative, neutral, inspiring,

2314
01:31:46,260 --> 01:31:48,420
basically anything that was salient for you

2315
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,980
at that particular time.

2316
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:52,540
And of course, if you want to put reflections

2317
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:55,020
about those particular events into that word document,

2318
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:56,380
you're more than welcome to do that.

2319
01:31:56,380 --> 01:32:01,020
But the basis of this self-concept developing exercise

2320
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:04,340
is just that, it's to develop a historical sense

2321
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:05,340
of yourself.

2322
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:07,380
Of course, bringing you up to present day

2323
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:09,420
where you will continue to add things

2324
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:12,100
to whatever word document goes into that particular folder

2325
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,900
for the age you happen to be now.

2326
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:14,740
Now, for some of you,

2327
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:17,580
this kind of autobiographical bullet pointing

2328
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,020
might seem like it's just that,

2329
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:21,900
some attempt to build or write an autobiography.

2330
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:24,100
But it's very important to remember

2331
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:26,040
that these folders are for you.

2332
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,260
These folders are not about writing a book

2333
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:29,220
about your life history.

2334
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,660
Although if you decide to do that with these folders

2335
01:32:31,660 --> 01:32:34,580
at some point down the line, that sounds great,

2336
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:36,540
but that's not the goal here.

2337
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:39,100
The goal is for you to build a structured,

2338
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,540
narrative representation of events

2339
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,500
that were key in your life.

2340
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:45,660
And as described in the series with Dr. Conti,

2341
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:49,100
this goes way beyond just understanding your past.

2342
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,180
This is really about understanding past.

2343
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:53,260
It's about understanding yourself at present.

2344
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:55,620
And indeed it threads into your goals

2345
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,580
and aspirations for the future.

2346
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,500
An important thing to understand about this tool

2347
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:04,060
or protocol is that it also has a incredible ability

2348
01:33:04,060 --> 01:33:08,380
to anchor you in your perception of the passage of time.

2349
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:10,980
Some of us track the passage of time better than others,

2350
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:14,220
both within the day and across days and years and so forth.

2351
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:17,020
But this exercise in particular is very good

2352
01:33:17,020 --> 01:33:20,380
at allowing you to see how much time you devoted

2353
01:33:20,380 --> 01:33:22,540
at a given stage of your life to a given endeavor,

2354
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:24,500
whether or not you're stuck in patterns

2355
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,220
whereby you're still engaging

2356
01:33:26,220 --> 01:33:27,820
in certain types of things professionally

2357
01:33:27,820 --> 01:33:29,780
or relationship wise,

2358
01:33:29,780 --> 01:33:32,540
or in any other number of different ways

2359
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:35,100
that have you in a pattern

2360
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:37,500
that may or may not be serving you well.

2361
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,700
I want to emphasize again that this exercise

2362
01:33:39,700 --> 01:33:41,540
is not about goal setting.

2363
01:33:41,540 --> 01:33:43,660
It's about your ability to build

2364
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:45,620
a structured narrative pattern

2365
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:48,100
from which you can look at it

2366
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:50,820
and then make a determination as to whether or not,

2367
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:53,820
you feel that you're currently on the right path for you.

2368
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:56,180
But it's not about projecting forward

2369
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:57,580
as to what your goals are.

2370
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:58,740
We'll soon talk about that.

2371
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:01,060
We'll talk about goals and aspirations in a moment.

2372
01:34:01,060 --> 01:34:03,300
This is really about better understanding

2373
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,980
what led you up to the place that you are now.

2374
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:08,060
And it really helps you pinpoint the key work

2375
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,860
that you need to do in terms of exploring your unconscious

2376
01:34:10,860 --> 01:34:12,940
and conscious mind using some tools

2377
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,580
that we're going to get into subsequently.

2378
01:34:14,580 --> 01:34:16,020
So there's really no strict rules

2379
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,020
about how to do this exactly,

2380
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:20,260
except that I do encourage you to make those increments

2381
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:22,300
across your lifespan manageable.

2382
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,740
I wouldn't suggest doing it one for every year.

2383
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:27,660
I wouldn't suggest a folder, one for every 10 years.

2384
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:29,980
I think a three to five year increment

2385
01:34:29,980 --> 01:34:31,340
seemed like a more reasonable

2386
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:33,060
and tractable way to go about this.

2387
01:34:33,060 --> 01:34:34,700
So that's one of the sorts of tools

2388
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:36,660
that Dr. Conti referred to

2389
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:39,460
as to how to build up one's self-concept,

2390
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:42,140
which directly relates to things such as our confidence,

2391
01:34:42,140 --> 01:34:44,820
our ability to track our own behavior,

2392
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,540
understand some of our motivations,

2393
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:48,020
both conscious and unconscious.

2394
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:51,460
But of course, that practice is mainly a conscious exercise.

2395
01:34:51,460 --> 01:34:54,460
It's really not tapping directly into the unconscious

2396
01:34:54,460 --> 01:34:57,060
in any kind of direct way as far as we know.

2397
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,340
Now we can contrast that with the tools and protocols

2398
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:01,820
that are designed to tap into the unconscious mind.

2399
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:03,660
And of course, there are a number of different ways

2400
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:05,260
to do this that were discussed

2401
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:07,620
in that four episode series with Dr. Conti.

2402
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,820
But one of the most powerful ways to do this

2403
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:13,540
is by thinking about and indeed sometimes writing about

2404
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:16,020
or even analyzing one's dreams.

2405
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:17,660
Now dream analysis is something

2406
01:35:17,660 --> 01:35:19,580
for which you can find a lot of books out there.

2407
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:20,580
There are a lot of theories.

2408
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:23,020
There's also a lot of argument that perhaps dream analysis,

2409
01:35:23,020 --> 01:35:24,820
which has roots in Freudian psychology,

2410
01:35:24,820 --> 01:35:28,980
as well as other traditions is perhaps not accurate.

2411
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:30,300
I don't think we want to consider

2412
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,580
whether or not dream analysis is accurate.

2413
01:35:32,580 --> 01:35:35,020
Rather, I think we should just acknowledge

2414
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:36,540
that when we are dreaming,

2415
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,260
in particular the dreams that we have

2416
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,220
toward the later part of our night,

2417
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:41,340
which are the dreams associated

2418
01:35:41,340 --> 01:35:42,940
with rapid eye movement sleep

2419
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:45,580
that tend to be very emotionally late in dreams

2420
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:48,620
as compared to the dreams that we have earlier in the night.

2421
01:35:48,620 --> 01:35:51,260
Well, when we consider the content of those dreams,

2422
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:53,140
even if we're not trying to interpret them,

2423
01:35:53,140 --> 01:35:55,540
it's very clear that those dreams reflect

2424
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:58,100
the unconscious mind controlling more

2425
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:00,380
of our internal dialogue

2426
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,660
or what we are experiencing at that time.

2427
01:36:02,660 --> 01:36:03,660
Whereas when we are awake,

2428
01:36:03,660 --> 01:36:06,660
our conscious mind tends to take over more of the narrative,

2429
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:08,660
the internal narrative and the control

2430
01:36:08,660 --> 01:36:10,260
of our feelings, thoughts and behaviors.

2431
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:11,260
But as I mentioned before,

2432
01:36:11,260 --> 01:36:14,100
the unconscious mind is always exerting an influence

2433
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:16,700
regardless of whether or not we are asleep or awake.

2434
01:36:16,740 --> 01:36:19,500
With that said, one way to explore the unconscious mind

2435
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,620
and to begin to get a better understanding

2436
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:23,060
about how it might be influencing

2437
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,540
our waking states and behaviors

2438
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:29,660
is to actually record and think about one's dreams.

2439
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:31,900
Now, of course, some people remember their dreams

2440
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:34,340
on a regular basis, other people don't.

2441
01:36:34,340 --> 01:36:37,340
Some people actually believe that they don't dream.

2442
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:39,580
Studies out of sleep laboratories at Stanford,

2443
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,580
University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and elsewhere

2444
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:44,100
all generally agree that everybody dreams,

2445
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:46,580
but not everybody remembers their dreams.

2446
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:50,100
So if you're interested in tapping into an understanding

2447
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,940
of what your dreams are telling you,

2448
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:55,140
which is basically a way of saying

2449
01:36:55,140 --> 01:36:59,700
what your unconscious mind or dialogue consists of,

2450
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:02,100
I highly recommend putting a journal.

2451
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,580
So this would be any kind of paper and pen

2452
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:05,900
or paper and pencil type journal.

2453
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:09,140
And the idea is this, if you wake up

2454
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:12,060
and you can remember your dream,

2455
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:14,860
write down a few key bullet points from that dream.

2456
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:16,700
If you feel you can write out the dream

2457
01:37:16,700 --> 01:37:19,060
in a very linear narrative, this happened,

2458
01:37:19,060 --> 01:37:20,140
then that happened, then this happened,

2459
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:20,980
then that happened, great.

2460
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:23,980
But most people find that their memory of their dream

2461
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:26,020
is rather fragmentary.

2462
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:28,940
Other people can't remember their dream,

2463
01:37:28,940 --> 01:37:30,580
or at least they wake up,

2464
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:32,300
they feel like they were having a dream,

2465
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:35,460
but they can't remember all of it or key components of it.

2466
01:37:35,460 --> 01:37:38,500
And for that, I suggest that you try keeping your body

2467
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:41,780
completely still and closing your eyes once again.

2468
01:37:41,780 --> 01:37:43,700
We don't quite understand why this is,

2469
01:37:43,700 --> 01:37:47,380
but when you look at the literature on dream recollection,

2470
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:51,020
it seems that by keeping one's body completely still

2471
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:53,980
with eyes closed, we have better access

2472
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:56,420
to whatever the contents of the dream

2473
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:58,140
that just occurred were, okay?

2474
01:37:58,140 --> 01:38:00,260
So if you wake up and you can't remember your dreams,

2475
01:38:00,260 --> 01:38:02,740
try lying still for a few minutes

2476
01:38:02,740 --> 01:38:05,660
and keeping your eyes closed and seeing whether or not

2477
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:08,060
that helps surface the content of that dream.

2478
01:38:08,060 --> 01:38:10,220
Other people find that they get up, they get out of bed,

2479
01:38:10,220 --> 01:38:12,460
and then sometime in the middle of the morning,

2480
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:13,900
maybe even later in the day,

2481
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,780
the contents of a dream will just come to them.

2482
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:16,980
Well, if that happens, great.

2483
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:19,900
I also highly recommend that you have a way to write down

2484
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,900
the contents of that dream.

2485
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,140
Now, what you're looking for

2486
01:38:23,140 --> 01:38:25,300
when you do this sort of tool or protocol,

2487
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:28,620
I encourage you to be wary of any immediate interpretation

2488
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:31,380
of, for instance, okay, animals in a dream mean children,

2489
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,980
although they could.

2490
01:38:32,980 --> 01:38:35,420
There's not a lot of science that really supports that

2491
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:36,700
as a firm statement.

2492
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,900
And of course, there are books out there and podcasts

2493
01:38:38,900 --> 01:38:40,420
and a ton of information

2494
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,060
trying to help you interpret your dreams.

2495
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:43,460
And while some of that can be fun

2496
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:45,580
and not all of it is entirely useless,

2497
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,700
the goal here is not to interpret your dreams.

2498
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,680
The goal here is to start recording

2499
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,060
some of the key takeaways,

2500
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:53,380
maybe even the entire narrative of the dreams

2501
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:55,620
that you have just prior to waking

2502
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:57,820
as a way to try and understand some of the themes

2503
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:02,060
that are occurring and recurring in the dialogue

2504
01:39:02,060 --> 01:39:04,100
that exists within your unconscious mind.

2505
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:06,220
So a key aspect of this tool is that

2506
01:39:06,220 --> 01:39:08,420
you're not going to take any one dream

2507
01:39:08,420 --> 01:39:11,140
as an enormously informative dream.

2508
01:39:11,140 --> 01:39:14,900
It might be, but more important in this particular tool

2509
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:17,260
is to write down the themes of a particular dream

2510
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:19,620
and then see whether or not those particular themes

2511
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:23,580
resurface again and again across different nights

2512
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,240
or across different dreams.

2513
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:29,260
The idea here is that things that are repeating thematically

2514
01:39:29,260 --> 01:39:32,860
will show up as different components in different dreams,

2515
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:35,500
but that by keeping a dream journal,

2516
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:38,200
you can start to identify some of these patterns

2517
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:40,940
that are occurring from one dream to the next

2518
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,380
as opposed to having the same dream over and over.

2519
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:45,660
But the point here is that you can explore the contents

2520
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:48,140
and the themes, that's really the most important word here,

2521
01:39:48,140 --> 01:39:51,960
the themes of your unconscious mind that is occurring

2522
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:54,540
if you start thinking about what's recurring

2523
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:56,440
during your dreams, because dreams are a time

2524
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:59,600
when your unconscious mind is dominating the narrative

2525
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,280
within your mind and brain.

2526
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:02,980
Now, for those of you that dream a lot

2527
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:04,340
and remember your dreams,

2528
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:06,740
as well as for those of you that do not,

2529
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:09,960
I would also encourage you to explore the contents

2530
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:13,820
of your thinking, that is thinking about your thinking

2531
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:15,600
during so-called liminal states.

2532
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,320
And the liminal state during which this can be

2533
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:20,160
particularly useful is right upon waking.

2534
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:21,600
So this is different than thinking about

2535
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,340
what you were dreaming about.

2536
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:26,760
This is about keeping your eyes closed and body still.

2537
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:29,000
We do think that that's important for doing this well,

2538
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:30,340
because once you start moving your body,

2539
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,760
you open your eyes and you start bringing in

2540
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:33,800
sensory experience for that day,

2541
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,680
your mind dramatically shifts towards conscious processing.

2542
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:40,280
But in that liminal state between sleeping and awake,

2543
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,960
when you wake up and you're a little sleepy,

2544
01:40:41,960 --> 01:40:43,400
maybe you don't want to get out of bed,

2545
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:45,880
and this happens to me all too often,

2546
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,220
try closing your eyes and remaining perfectly still

2547
01:40:48,220 --> 01:40:51,360
for maybe one to three minutes, maybe five minutes,

2548
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,360
and just pay attention to where your mind goes.

2549
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:56,720
Now, you might fall back asleep, be mindful of that,

2550
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:59,040
depending on what you need to do that morning.

2551
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:03,080
But a lot of people will find that their mind goes into

2552
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,840
this place that's neither sleep nor awake, right?

2553
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,200
This is a state that very much resembles the state

2554
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:11,280
people achieve in things like yoga nidra, yoga sleep,

2555
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,680
or in non-sleep deep rest,

2556
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:15,040
although it tends to be more dominated

2557
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,080
by the unconscious mind, a little bit more sleep-like.

2558
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:20,840
Now, some people find this practice to be difficult

2559
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:22,440
because they're the sort of people that wake up

2560
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,700
and they're just immediately ready to go.

2561
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,680
Most people, however, myself included,

2562
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,560
find that when they wake up,

2563
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:30,200
the mind isn't completely alert yet,

2564
01:41:30,200 --> 01:41:32,000
and you can use that period,

2565
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,560
again, just maybe two or three minutes, maybe five minutes,

2566
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:39,980
to start to pay attention to the contents of your thinking,

2567
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:42,760
see whether or not your thinking migrates from

2568
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:47,760
something related to work or to relationship or to self

2569
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,640
or to something you want to do

2570
01:41:49,640 --> 01:41:53,640
or something that you're anxious about and so on and so on.

2571
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:55,520
And here too, you'll want to write this down.

2572
01:41:55,520 --> 01:41:57,380
So this is very much like the dream journaling

2573
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:58,600
we just talked about,

2574
01:41:58,600 --> 01:42:01,400
but it's slightly easier for most people to access,

2575
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:03,160
especially people who have a hard time

2576
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,960
remembering their dreams.

2577
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,440
And again, it's an opportunity to access

2578
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:09,920
some of the contents of your unconscious mind,

2579
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:13,360
to learn to look at and see what's going on

2580
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,360
in your unconscious mind in a way that's very difficult,

2581
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:18,040
if not impossible to do,

2582
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,280
unless you're working with somebody who's very good

2583
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:22,360
at accessing the unconscious,

2584
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:25,120
such as a skilled psychiatrist or psychoanalyst,

2585
01:42:25,120 --> 01:42:28,880
and in that way, allowing you to do introspective work,

2586
01:42:28,880 --> 01:42:32,360
which is not structured in terms of thinking,

2587
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:33,800
trying to think about like, what do I want?

2588
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:34,960
What's going on?

2589
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:35,800
Why did they do that?

2590
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:36,920
Why did I react that way?

2591
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:37,760
Nothing like that.

2592
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:40,240
You're simply observing your mind

2593
01:42:40,240 --> 01:42:43,260
and seeing what's geysering up from the unconscious.

2594
01:42:43,260 --> 01:42:45,660
That is, you're getting a portal

2595
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:47,660
into that portion of the iceberg

2596
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:50,440
that resides below the surface of the water.

2597
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,440
The next set of tools for exploring the self,

2598
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:54,760
self-concept, et cetera,

2599
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:58,120
from that four episode series with Dr. Conti is journaling.

2600
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,520
I'm going to do an entire episode

2601
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,560
of the Huberman Lab podcast about journaling.

2602
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:03,400
And there are a lot of different kinds of journaling

2603
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,760
and fortunately, there are a lot of great

2604
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,800
peer-reviewed studies about the power of journaling

2605
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,280
for processing all sorts of things

2606
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:11,800
like emotional states, trauma, et cetera.

2607
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:14,240
There are basically two categories of journaling

2608
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:17,440
that are very useful to carry out on a consistent basis.

2609
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:19,160
And when I say consistent basis,

2610
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:20,200
that could mean every day,

2611
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:21,440
or it could mean three times a week,

2612
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:23,420
it could even be once a week.

2613
01:43:23,420 --> 01:43:25,320
There are really no hard and fast rules about this,

2614
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:27,000
but when we think about journaling,

2615
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:28,880
there are really two main styles of journaling.

2616
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,960
One is going to be free associative journaling.

2617
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,360
Sometimes people talk about this as a data dump, right?

2618
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,600
Typically, people will talk about the data dump

2619
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:38,120
as the morning notes,

2620
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:40,360
which is when you wake up in the morning,

2621
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:41,360
you've got a lot on your mind,

2622
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:42,600
you can't organize your mind.

2623
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:45,240
People who have a hard time structuring their thinking

2624
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:47,580
and behavior often find this very useful,

2625
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:50,360
which is to take out a journal or a piece of paper.

2626
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:51,500
Again, this is just for you.

2627
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,220
It's important that you realize

2628
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:56,640
and really make sure that you're the only person

2629
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:57,760
that's going to see these notes,

2630
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,000
because a lot of people get into self-monitoring

2631
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,280
when they're doing their journaling.

2632
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,200
They're thinking about, well, how's this going to look?

2633
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:04,180
Is my handwriting okay?

2634
01:44:04,180 --> 01:44:05,140
How's my punctuation?

2635
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:06,360
What are people going to think?

2636
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,120
Is this going to be a good book or not a good book?

2637
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:10,680
Listen, none of this journaling that we're referring to

2638
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:14,120
is about your book or your autobiography.

2639
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,200
This is really just for you.

2640
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:17,840
This is an exploration of yourself

2641
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:20,600
that's designed to help you enhance your concept,

2642
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,880
that is your understanding of self,

2643
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,240
and indeed translates to better confidence,

2644
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:28,320
better understanding of your goals and aspirations,

2645
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,800
better understanding of your unhealthy patterns

2646
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:32,560
and defenses and on and on.

2647
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,280
And so again, the two styles of journaling

2648
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,560
are free association.

2649
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,080
So where you literally just write down

2650
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,840
anything that comes to mind

2651
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,360
or that you feel like writing down

2652
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,680
within a given period of time.

2653
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:46,220
For most people, 10 minutes is ample time to do that.

2654
01:44:46,220 --> 01:44:47,700
For some people, five will be enough.

2655
01:44:47,700 --> 01:44:51,080
And for some who have the time, maybe 30 minutes.

2656
01:44:51,080 --> 01:44:53,640
But for me, and I think for most people out there,

2657
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,360
anywhere from five to 10 minutes

2658
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:57,600
of this data dump free association,

2659
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:59,240
it could be your anxieties, what you're thinking about,

2660
01:44:59,240 --> 01:45:00,240
what you're anxious about.

2661
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:03,200
Really could be about anything that comes to mind.

2662
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,720
And this free association process can be very useful

2663
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:09,680
for clearing out the clutter, so to speak.

2664
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:12,400
The other style of journaling that's equally useful,

2665
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:15,720
but for different reasons, is structured journaling

2666
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:19,420
to have a goal for a given entry on a given day.

2667
01:45:19,420 --> 01:45:20,680
And again, this could be done in the morning,

2668
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,000
afternoon or night.

2669
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,440
And the idea would be that you would set an intention,

2670
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,960
and by intention, I mean a specific topic

2671
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,120
that you're going to restrict your writing to.

2672
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:32,560
And that writing should be about self,

2673
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,420
in particular goals and aspirations.

2674
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:38,440
What you've wanted in the past, yes,

2675
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,880
but also what you want at present,

2676
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,600
what you might want in the future for yourself.

2677
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:45,880
These could of course be material things,

2678
01:45:45,880 --> 01:45:49,320
but in general, this is more about aspirations

2679
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:52,580
of things that you would like to accomplish or generate.

2680
01:45:52,580 --> 01:45:54,160
And the key word there is generate.

2681
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,120
And if you listen to the four episode series

2682
01:45:56,120 --> 01:46:00,080
with Dr. Conti, he talked about three drives

2683
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,480
that exist in all of us.

2684
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:04,240
These three drives are the aggressive drive,

2685
01:46:04,240 --> 01:46:07,200
the pleasure drive and the generative drive.

2686
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,960
And we don't need to go into a lengthy description

2687
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,360
about these drives right now.

2688
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:13,260
If you're curious about them and what they represent

2689
01:46:13,260 --> 01:46:16,280
and how they can be in balance or out of balance

2690
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:18,200
and how that serves us or doesn't serve us,

2691
01:46:18,200 --> 01:46:19,960
please check out that four episode series

2692
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:21,840
with Dr. Conti, because he goes into that

2693
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,120
in a fair amount of detail and also in an actionable way.

2694
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:29,120
But the key thing here is that we're generative.

2695
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:31,520
One of the things that I asked Dr. Conti at the outset

2696
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:34,360
and throughout the entire series was,

2697
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,160
what is mental health?

2698
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,400
We talk about physical health and we have some idea

2699
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:40,800
of what that represents, healthy blood pressure,

2700
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:43,120
the ability to do certain forms of physical movement,

2701
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:44,760
cognitive abilities.

2702
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:47,480
I asked him, how can we define mental health?

2703
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:50,200
And his answer was very straightforward and very powerful.

2704
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:54,600
He said, what we all need to aspire to is to be in states,

2705
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:58,800
that is in the verb actions of agency and gratitude

2706
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,480
for as much of our waking life as possible.

2707
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:02,560
Now that sounds great, right?

2708
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,840
A sense of agency, the ability to exert influence

2709
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:07,960
over our internal state and affect the world around us

2710
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:09,880
in positive ways, positive relationships,

2711
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:11,880
reach our goals, as well as gratitude,

2712
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:13,320
being grateful for the opportunities

2713
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:15,560
that we've been afforded, even grateful perhaps

2714
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,320
for some of the challenges that we've been afforded

2715
01:47:17,320 --> 01:47:19,400
or that were selected for us

2716
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,440
that we had no control over

2717
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:24,440
and carrying that agency and gratitude forward

2718
01:47:24,440 --> 01:47:26,680
because it gives rise to a sense of peace,

2719
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:28,280
contentment and delight.

2720
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:30,440
So all of that sounds wonderful, right?

2721
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:33,120
Be in agency and gratitude as a verb states,

2722
01:47:33,120 --> 01:47:35,440
experience peace, contentment and delight.

2723
01:47:35,440 --> 01:47:36,760
But Dr. Conti acknowledged,

2724
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:39,200
and we spent a good amount of time discussing the fact

2725
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:41,760
that doesn't happen just because we decide we want to.

2726
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:44,480
In fact, agency and gratitude,

2727
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,040
peace, contentment and delight,

2728
01:47:46,040 --> 01:47:48,720
guys are up from a whole set of other processes

2729
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:51,560
that we have to engage in on a regular basis.

2730
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:54,520
And that really gets us back to those three drives.

2731
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:56,440
He talked about how people tend to have

2732
01:47:56,440 --> 01:47:58,200
more or less aggressive drive,

2733
01:47:58,200 --> 01:48:00,560
not just aggression in terms of violence,

2734
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,000
although some people do have that,

2735
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:03,880
but in terms of their determination

2736
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:06,320
and their sort of leaning into friction,

2737
01:48:06,320 --> 01:48:07,760
even seeking out a friction.

2738
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:09,400
People are on a continuum

2739
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:11,000
with respect to the aggressive drive.

2740
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,800
He also talked about the pleasure drive

2741
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:14,600
and the fact that people are on a continuum

2742
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:18,920
of the desire for pleasure to either be a hedonist

2743
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:21,040
or somebody who really avoids pleasure

2744
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,920
and kind of restricts pleasure from oneself.

2745
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:25,240
And again, that these things can slide around

2746
01:48:25,240 --> 01:48:27,960
depending on our life circumstances, our age, et cetera,

2747
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:31,960
but that it's very important that we have a sense

2748
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:35,160
of where we are on that continuum of an aggressive drive

2749
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:36,640
and a pleasure drive.

2750
01:48:36,640 --> 01:48:39,920
And here's the most important thing,

2751
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,120
that our aggressive drive and pleasure drive

2752
01:48:42,120 --> 01:48:45,440
never outsize our generative drive.

2753
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,680
And that engaging our generative drive

2754
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:49,640
is really the hallmark of mental health

2755
01:48:49,640 --> 01:48:52,720
that leads to that sense of agency and gratitude,

2756
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:54,320
peace, contentment and delight.

2757
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,720
And he defined the generative drive in the following way.

2758
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:00,240
He said, the generative drive is our desire to create,

2759
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,880
build and contribute to the world in meaningful ways

2760
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:05,440
and appreciate the process to get there.

2761
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,320
It is the core feature of our mental health.

2762
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,160
So if you want to learn more about the various drives

2763
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,880
and how they interact and how to access

2764
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,880
more generative drive, again, that's all contained

2765
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,120
in the four episode series with Dr. Conti,

2766
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,800
but taking us back to the tools and takeaways

2767
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,600
from that four episode series,

2768
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,400
the process of journaling in free association mode

2769
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:28,280
or the process of journaling in a conscious structured way

2770
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:31,760
is really about trying to access the generative drive

2771
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:34,480
and to build up that generative drive.

2772
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:37,200
And one of the key things about conscious journaling

2773
01:49:37,200 --> 01:49:39,280
is that it affords us the opportunity

2774
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:42,800
in a way that's not going to be seen by anybody else

2775
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:46,040
to really think about what our goals and aspirations are.

2776
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,320
Now you might say, you know,

2777
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:49,320
I can't even think about my goals and aspirations.

2778
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:50,800
I don't know what I want.

2779
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:51,640
Well, that's fine.

2780
01:49:51,640 --> 01:49:53,000
Then you should journal about that.

2781
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:56,720
However, most people have some sense of what they would like,

2782
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:59,640
but most people are simply not comfortable

2783
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:02,920
with writing those things out or even thinking about them.

2784
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:05,240
And if you reflect on that, how could it ever be

2785
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:07,640
that you would achieve those goals and aspirations

2786
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:10,280
if you're not even feeling comfortable enough

2787
01:50:10,280 --> 01:50:12,640
to think about them or write about them?

2788
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,680
And so the process of thinking about

2789
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:17,360
and writing about your goals and aspirations

2790
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,320
is perhaps one of the key first steps

2791
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:23,880
towards being able to actualize those goals and aspirations.

2792
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,280
And for some people, this might be very easy to do.

2793
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:27,320
You can simply write down, say,

2794
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:29,240
I want to be married by this age,

2795
01:50:29,240 --> 01:50:31,000
and I want to make X amount of money,

2796
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,480
and I want to live here or there.

2797
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:35,200
And certainly those sorts of goals and aspirations

2798
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:37,600
are perfectly valid for this type of exercise,

2799
01:50:38,600 --> 01:50:40,040
but so are the sorts of goals and aspirations

2800
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:41,720
that relate to feeling states.

2801
01:50:41,720 --> 01:50:44,360
Like, yeah, I would like to feel part of a community.

2802
01:50:44,360 --> 01:50:47,120
I would like to feel like an active contributor

2803
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:48,200
to a community.

2804
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,240
And then the essential thing is to really flesh out

2805
01:50:50,240 --> 01:50:52,720
the detail around those goals and aspirations.

2806
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:54,160
You know, what size community?

2807
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:56,560
Where do you see yourself fitting into this community?

2808
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:59,280
Are you doing this alongside other people or by yourself?

2809
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,040
In other words, to really get comfortable thinking

2810
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:03,960
about what your goals and aspirations are,

2811
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:07,080
again, completely from the perspective of self

2812
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:09,080
and that you are going to be the only person

2813
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:11,200
to see this particular document.

2814
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:12,640
Now, I will be the first to admit

2815
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,160
that the exercise that I just described,

2816
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,960
not the free association journaling,

2817
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,200
but the structured journaling of goals and aspirations,

2818
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:24,080
I and many people find to be difficult to initiate.

2819
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:25,880
Difficult to initiate because there seems to be

2820
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:29,000
a bit of internal anxiety and friction around doing it.

2821
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,120
There seems to be something that keeps many, not all,

2822
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:36,160
but many people from feeling as if they are even allowed

2823
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:38,120
to think about their goals and aspirations

2824
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:40,720
because many people default to, well, then, you know,

2825
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,840
I'll just be disappointed because it's not going to work out.

2826
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:44,920
I don't want to think about what I want

2827
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,800
because then I'll just be more disappointed.

2828
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,040
And that particular frame of mind was actually discussed

2829
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,800
in the series with Dr. Conti.

2830
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:54,240
And he convinced me, and he's the expert,

2831
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:57,340
that the opposite is actually true.

2832
01:51:57,340 --> 01:51:59,600
When we are able to overcome some of our anxiety

2833
01:51:59,600 --> 01:52:01,840
and really think about in a dedicated way

2834
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,200
what we would like to create for ourselves in our lives,

2835
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:05,800
both present and future,

2836
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,980
and keeping in mind our events of past

2837
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:11,060
because we always carry that life narrative forward,

2838
01:52:11,060 --> 01:52:13,120
then we are in a far better place

2839
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:15,340
to actualize those goals and aspirations.

2840
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:17,720
And he explained a variety of reasons why that's the case

2841
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:19,440
in his clinical observations

2842
01:52:19,440 --> 01:52:21,040
and some of the other observations

2843
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:22,400
that really support that statement.

2844
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:25,020
So I highly encourage you to think about embracing

2845
01:52:25,020 --> 01:52:26,060
a process of journaling.

2846
01:52:26,060 --> 01:52:27,720
Again, you don't have to do this every day.

2847
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:29,280
The journaling and the dream analysis

2848
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:30,660
take a little bit more time,

2849
01:52:30,660 --> 01:52:32,460
but they are oh so valuable

2850
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,820
for better understanding oneself concept.

2851
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:39,020
And they really thread forward into real everyday actions

2852
01:52:39,020 --> 01:52:42,100
that can positively enrich your mood and mental health.

2853
01:52:42,100 --> 01:52:44,300
Now, any description of science-based tools

2854
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:46,620
for mood and mental health would be incomplete

2855
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:50,380
without including some tools related to processing of traumas.

2856
01:52:50,380 --> 01:52:53,260
Now, the processing of traumas is something that,

2857
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:56,900
especially in the case of major traumas or repeated traumas,

2858
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:58,460
really should be carried out

2859
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:01,620
in concert with a expert-trained clinician.

2860
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:03,980
That is a psychologist or psychiatrist

2861
01:53:03,980 --> 01:53:07,780
who's trained in helping people work through traumas.

2862
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:09,900
However, even if you're working with somebody

2863
01:53:09,900 --> 01:53:11,840
who's expert in processing trauma,

2864
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:15,020
there are specific tools that you can use on your own

2865
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:17,740
to accelerate that process.

2866
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:19,540
And for people who are working through

2867
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:21,980
what are sometimes called more minor traumas,

2868
01:53:21,980 --> 01:53:24,060
these are sometimes called big T, big traumas,

2869
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:25,540
and little T, little traumas.

2870
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:28,380
However, that nomenclature doesn't take into account

2871
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:31,340
the fact that most of us can probably tell

2872
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:34,300
what the big traumas are for ourselves and for others,

2873
01:53:34,300 --> 01:53:35,420
but sometimes it's hard to tell

2874
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:37,140
whether or not those small traumas,

2875
01:53:37,140 --> 01:53:39,780
the little T traumas, actually are big T traumas.

2876
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,900
So this is one of the major reasons

2877
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:43,620
why working with a licensed professional

2878
01:53:43,620 --> 01:53:45,140
is really going to be advantageous

2879
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:47,980
and in many cases necessary to work through trauma.

2880
01:53:47,980 --> 01:53:51,220
That said, the self-directed protocols

2881
01:53:51,220 --> 01:53:53,300
for working through trauma

2882
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:56,220
have a lot to do with how we think about,

2883
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:58,100
but more importantly at times,

2884
01:53:58,100 --> 01:54:00,340
how we talk about those traumas.

2885
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:02,020
And Dr. Paul Conte talked about this,

2886
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:04,220
not so much in the four episode series with us,

2887
01:54:04,220 --> 01:54:06,660
but in a particular podcast episode

2888
01:54:06,660 --> 01:54:08,780
that he did with Dr. Peter Attia,

2889
01:54:08,780 --> 01:54:10,460
who some of you are perhaps familiar with

2890
01:54:10,460 --> 01:54:12,820
for his incredible podcast, The Drive,

2891
01:54:12,820 --> 01:54:15,300
but also for his excellent book, Outlive,

2892
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:18,860
which deals with health span and lifespan or longevity.

2893
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:20,860
Now, in that particular conversation

2894
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:23,340
with Dr. Conte and Dr. Attia,

2895
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:26,780
Dr. Conte emphasized the fact that one of the ways

2896
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:28,780
that we hold ourselves back

2897
01:54:28,860 --> 01:54:32,820
and indeed can exacerbate the negative consequences of trauma

2898
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:35,700
are the ways in which we modify our language

2899
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:37,420
to describe those traumas.

2900
01:54:37,420 --> 01:54:39,780
And what he said, which is so important,

2901
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:43,300
is that oftentimes we don't allow ourselves

2902
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:47,100
to use language that's as big as is necessary

2903
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:50,300
to explain that trauma and the impact of that trauma

2904
01:54:50,300 --> 01:54:52,100
on us and on others.

2905
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:56,500
In fact, many people start to relegate their language

2906
01:54:56,500 --> 01:54:59,100
to more passable in a given sentence

2907
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:01,300
or passable in a given conversation.

2908
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:04,260
Now, what we're not talking about here is the idea that,

2909
01:55:04,260 --> 01:55:07,020
okay, you know, screaming at somebody else about your trauma

2910
01:55:07,020 --> 01:55:08,940
or using a lot of four-letter words

2911
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:10,340
is necessarily the best way

2912
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:11,900
to process that trauma verbally.

2913
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:14,820
However, we are talking about allowing oneself,

2914
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:17,820
either in spoken form or in written form,

2915
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:20,500
to really allow the magnitude of a given trauma

2916
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:24,780
to be expressed with a fair degree of intensity

2917
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:28,140
and language that can capture at least some

2918
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:31,580
of what that trauma represented for us or for others.

2919
01:55:31,580 --> 01:55:33,660
Now, as Dr. Conte pointed out,

2920
01:55:33,660 --> 01:55:35,980
all too often we do the opposite.

2921
01:55:35,980 --> 01:55:38,860
What ends up happening is people will experience

2922
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:41,260
some sort of trauma, either major or minor,

2923
01:55:41,260 --> 01:55:43,380
maybe single or repeated trauma,

2924
01:55:43,380 --> 01:55:46,540
and rather than being comfortable talking about it,

2925
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:49,260
rather than using language that captures at least some

2926
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:52,020
of the magnitude of that trauma for them,

2927
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:56,220
people start to talk about that trauma less frequently.

2928
01:55:56,220 --> 01:55:58,460
They start to distract themselves

2929
01:55:58,460 --> 01:56:00,660
to think about other things instead of talking about

2930
01:56:00,660 --> 01:56:02,220
or thinking about that trauma.

2931
01:56:02,220 --> 01:56:04,860
And what happens is that trauma roots

2932
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:06,420
into our unconscious mind

2933
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:09,380
and starts to impact us in negative ways.

2934
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:13,060
Now, those negative ways include increases in anxiety,

2935
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:14,580
disruptions in sleep.

2936
01:56:14,580 --> 01:56:17,220
In fact, one of the common ways in which trauma manifests

2937
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,500
in disruptions in sleep by way of rooting

2938
01:56:19,500 --> 01:56:23,660
into our unconscious is that people wake up at 2.30

2939
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:25,300
or three o'clock in the morning,

2940
01:56:25,300 --> 01:56:27,660
let's just say after several hours of being asleep,

2941
01:56:27,660 --> 01:56:30,140
and immediately they're thinking about that thing

2942
01:56:30,140 --> 01:56:32,140
that happened and they're upset about it.

2943
01:56:32,140 --> 01:56:34,780
The idea is that when we push those traumas down,

2944
01:56:34,780 --> 01:56:37,780
when we don't talk about them with people that we trust,

2945
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:39,980
when we don't have a way to consciously process

2946
01:56:39,980 --> 01:56:44,580
those traumas using language that at least partially matches

2947
01:56:44,580 --> 01:56:48,180
the magnitude of the impact of those traumas for us,

2948
01:56:48,180 --> 01:56:51,180
well, then those traumas impact our unconscious mind

2949
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:53,260
in ways that lead our unconscious mind

2950
01:56:53,260 --> 01:56:55,340
to literally wake us up in the middle of the night

2951
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:56,980
and remind us of that thing.

2952
01:56:56,980 --> 01:56:58,980
It's as if it's being thrown back in our face

2953
01:56:58,980 --> 01:56:59,900
over and over.

2954
01:56:59,900 --> 01:57:02,180
Also, sometimes traumas will root their way down

2955
01:57:02,180 --> 01:57:04,980
into our unconscious and then they will resurface

2956
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:08,740
in the mode of compulsive or obsessive thinking

2957
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:11,180
about that thing or perhaps other things.

2958
01:57:11,180 --> 01:57:14,700
Again, the unconscious mind has a interesting

2959
01:57:14,700 --> 01:57:16,820
and complicated number of different ways

2960
01:57:16,820 --> 01:57:21,820
that it defends us in ways that it can create denial,

2961
01:57:21,820 --> 01:57:24,580
distraction, that we might get hyper-focused on work

2962
01:57:24,580 --> 01:57:26,980
as a way to not think about the trauma

2963
01:57:26,980 --> 01:57:29,500
or hyper-focused on some details in our environment

2964
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:30,980
and just really trying to focus on that

2965
01:57:30,980 --> 01:57:33,180
because it's much easier to process

2966
01:57:33,180 --> 01:57:35,220
and handle that than these traumas.

2967
01:57:35,220 --> 01:57:37,660
Again, the processing of trauma is a whole landscape

2968
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:42,060
into itself that actually was beautifully described

2969
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:44,660
in terms of how it arises within us

2970
01:57:44,660 --> 01:57:48,220
and how to process traumas in a really structured way

2971
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:51,380
in a just fabulous book that was written by Dr. Conti

2972
01:57:51,380 --> 01:57:53,260
called The Invisible Epidemic,

2973
01:57:53,260 --> 01:57:55,660
How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It.

2974
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:57,860
And in that book, Dr. Conti explains a number

2975
01:57:57,860 --> 01:58:00,340
of different ways that we can do self-directed work

2976
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:02,540
as well as work with licensed professionals

2977
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:05,100
to process traumas and help us move through those traumas

2978
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:08,540
so that they are not negatively impacting us going forward.

2979
01:58:08,540 --> 01:58:11,060
So I really encourage anyone that's trying to process traumas

2980
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:14,340
from the past and or present to check out Dr. Conti's book

2981
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,300
because it's a spectacular resource.

2982
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:18,700
But in terms of the tools related to processing trauma

2983
01:58:18,700 --> 01:58:20,620
that we're talking about right now,

2984
01:58:20,620 --> 01:58:24,100
I think this point about really making sure

2985
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:27,620
that we allow ourselves to verbally process

2986
01:58:27,620 --> 01:58:29,740
and emotionally process that trauma

2987
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:33,340
in a way that there's room for using language

2988
01:58:33,340 --> 01:58:35,940
that captures some of the magnitude of that trauma

2989
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:38,460
and how it impacted us and others

2990
01:58:38,460 --> 01:58:40,340
is going to be very important

2991
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:42,700
because otherwise what ends up happening

2992
01:58:42,700 --> 01:58:46,460
is that we tend to adopt feelings of guilt and shame

2993
01:58:46,460 --> 01:58:49,780
around those traumas simply by not talking about them,

2994
01:58:49,780 --> 01:58:51,140
by having them go inward.

2995
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:53,540
And then they start to negatively impact

2996
01:58:53,540 --> 01:58:55,780
our unconscious mind and then our unconscious mind

2997
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:57,260
tries to throw them up to the surface

2998
01:58:57,260 --> 01:58:58,900
for our conscious mind to recognize

2999
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,740
by waking us up from sleep.

3000
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:04,020
And in some cases, by leveraging those unhealthy defenses,

3001
01:59:04,020 --> 01:59:07,580
things like denial, things like the overindulgence

3002
01:59:07,580 --> 01:59:09,740
in alcohol, overindulgence of drugs,

3003
01:59:09,740 --> 01:59:11,580
ways to distract ourselves,

3004
01:59:11,580 --> 01:59:13,900
as well as projection and sublimation

3005
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:16,020
and the other types of defenses

3006
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:18,780
that Dr. Conti talked about in the four episode series.

3007
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:22,620
Again, those defenses are not necessarily good or bad.

3008
01:59:22,620 --> 01:59:24,420
It depends on the circumstances.

3009
01:59:24,420 --> 01:59:27,180
The unconscious mind is not trying to harm us.

3010
01:59:27,180 --> 01:59:29,460
Your unconscious mind is part of you.

3011
01:59:29,460 --> 01:59:30,740
It is you.

3012
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:33,140
But of course it is you acting in concert

3013
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:34,260
with your conscious mind.

3014
01:59:34,260 --> 01:59:36,260
And so really the tools and protocols

3015
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:38,740
from the four episode series with Dr. Conti

3016
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:42,060
are aimed at helping you feel and access

3017
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:45,260
more sense of agency and gratitude on a regular basis,

3018
01:59:45,260 --> 01:59:47,620
more peace, contentment and delight.

3019
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:51,860
And doing so by touching into those different drives,

3020
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:53,420
understanding what they are,

3021
01:59:53,420 --> 01:59:55,300
the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive,

3022
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:58,060
and really making sure that your generative drive,

3023
01:59:58,060 --> 02:00:00,100
again, I love this description of the generative drive

3024
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:01,660
so much so that I'm going to read it again,

3025
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:05,500
because this is really what it means to be mentally healthy.

3026
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,700
Again, the generative drive is our desire

3027
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:09,660
to create, build and contribute to the world

3028
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:12,780
in a meaningful way and appreciate the process to get there.

3029
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:15,580
It is the core feature of our mental health.

3030
02:00:15,580 --> 02:00:17,940
So being able to access that generative drive

3031
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:20,420
on a regular basis is really what this thing

3032
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:23,020
that we call mental health is all about.

3033
02:00:23,020 --> 02:00:24,820
And the tools that I just described,

3034
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:27,180
of course can be combined with in any number

3035
02:00:27,180 --> 02:00:29,060
of different ways with the tools that I described

3036
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:30,980
gleaned largely from the episode

3037
02:00:30,980 --> 02:00:32,540
with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett.

3038
02:00:32,540 --> 02:00:36,620
And so what you now have is a kit of tools and protocols

3039
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:38,100
for improving mood and mental health,

3040
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:40,740
some of which are grounded in that core six,

3041
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:43,900
the first principles of self care

3042
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:46,340
are always going to be getting your physiology right

3043
02:00:46,340 --> 02:00:48,900
so that your psychology can be right.

3044
02:00:48,900 --> 02:00:51,620
As well, of course, you want to emphasize tools

3045
02:00:51,620 --> 02:00:54,900
and protocols that build up your psychological processes

3046
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,180
and concept of self.

3047
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:58,620
That's what the tools from the Conti series

3048
02:00:58,620 --> 02:01:00,300
that we just described are all about.

3049
02:01:00,300 --> 02:01:02,700
And then the tools from the episode

3050
02:01:02,700 --> 02:01:05,220
with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett sort of bridge the two

3051
02:01:05,220 --> 02:01:07,100
because she talked about both the physiological

3052
02:01:07,100 --> 02:01:10,940
and the psychological tools that really represent ways

3053
02:01:10,940 --> 02:01:12,580
to enhance our mood and mental health.

3054
02:01:12,580 --> 02:01:15,500
And so by threading these three things together,

3055
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,940
I believe it really arms us with the greatest degree

3056
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:21,260
of optimism and capacity to take control of this thing

3057
02:01:21,260 --> 02:01:22,980
that we call our mood and emotions,

3058
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:25,580
and to, of course, allow ourselves to feel

3059
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:26,780
the negative things we need to feel,

3060
02:01:26,780 --> 02:01:28,540
but then process them in healthy ways

3061
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:31,460
and to exist as much as is reasonably possible

3062
02:01:31,460 --> 02:01:35,380
in generally optimistic upbeat states

3063
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:38,540
that allow us to engage our generative drive.

3064
02:01:38,540 --> 02:01:41,660
And although we covered a lot of tools during this episode,

3065
02:01:41,660 --> 02:01:43,900
again, I want to emphasize that the idea

3066
02:01:43,900 --> 02:01:46,340
isn't to necessarily do all of them all at once,

3067
02:01:46,340 --> 02:01:48,460
maybe just pick one or two and start to implement them

3068
02:01:48,460 --> 02:01:49,820
on a regular basis.

3069
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:52,260
And by implementing those, there's no reason to think

3070
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:53,940
that you would be significantly eating

3071
02:01:53,940 --> 02:01:55,900
into your other demands on your time,

3072
02:01:55,900 --> 02:01:57,740
because ultimately the whole purpose

3073
02:01:57,740 --> 02:02:00,100
of having elevated mood and mental health

3074
02:02:00,100 --> 02:02:02,420
is so that you can have better relationship to yourself

3075
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:04,220
and better relationship to others

3076
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:05,700
and to the world around you.

Not so much on today's episode,

3093
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:41,260
but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3094
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:42,460
we discussed supplements.

3095
02:02:42,460 --> 02:02:44,300
While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

3096
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:46,620
many people derive tremendous benefit from them

3097
02:02:46,620 --> 02:02:50,340
for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support, and focus.

3098
02:02:50,340 --> 02:02:51,940
To learn more about the supplements discussed

3099
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:53,500
on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3100
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,140
you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,

3101
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:59,020
so that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

3102
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:00,940
If you're not already following me on social media,

3103
02:03:00,940 --> 02:03:03,540
I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

3104
02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:06,740
So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,

3105
02:03:06,740 --> 02:03:08,620
Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

3106
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:10,060
And on all those platforms,

3107
02:03:10,060 --> 02:03:12,140
I discuss science and science-related tools,

3108
02:03:12,140 --> 02:03:13,740
some of which overlaps with the content

3109
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:14,980
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

3110
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:16,940
but much of which is distinct from the content

3111
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:18,380
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

3112
02:03:18,380 --> 02:03:21,580
So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

3113
02:03:21,580 --> 02:03:22,780

Toolkits are brief PDFs that describe in bullet point form

3121
02:03:36,500 --> 02:03:39,140
tools for, for instance, enhancing sleep,

3122
02:03:39,140 --> 02:03:41,220
neuroplasticity, deliberate cold exposure,

3123
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:42,940
deliberate heat exposure, fitness,

3124
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:45,100
dopamine regulation, and much more.
