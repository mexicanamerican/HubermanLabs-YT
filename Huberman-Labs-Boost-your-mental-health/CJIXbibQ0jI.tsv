0	2280	Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
2280	3720	where we discuss science
3720	5920	and science-based tools for everyday life.
9200	10240	I'm Andrew Huberman,
10240	13240	and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
13240	15220	at Stanford School of Medicine.
15220	18520	Today we are discussing tools for mood and mental health.
18520	20240	I will include tools and resources
20240	22440	taken from the guest episode that I did
22440	24560	with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,
24560	27360	who is a psychologist and neuroscientist
27400	30640	whose laboratory focuses on mood and emotions.
30640	33480	During that episode, she mentioned several important tools
33480	35320	that I do believe everybody should apply
35320	37440	and that indeed I've been applying to my own life
37440	40360	and have found to be extremely beneficial.
40360	41240	I will also highlight
41240	43400	some of the specific research articles
43400	44880	those tools are based on,
44880	48480	which were not covered in the podcast with Lisa.
48480	50040	I will also discuss tools gleaned
50040	53160	from the four episode series that I did on mental health
53160	54640	with Dr. Paul Conti,
54640	57680	who is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry.
57680	60240	And that episode, as some of you may already know,
60240	62980	focused on mental health and the self,
62980	64680	as well as relationships.
64680	68200	And it included a deep discussion of what is the self.
68200	70920	We talked about the unconscious mind and the conscious mind.
70920	72680	And we also covered a lot of tools
72680	74360	for understanding oneself,
74360	76340	both within the context of therapy,
76340	78480	but also within the context of things
78480	82620	that one can do alone and that require zero cost.
82620	83900	In addition, we talked about tools
83900	85300	for improving relationships.
85300	87140	We talked about first principles of self care.
87140	88980	So I will provide highlights and takeaways
88980	91300	of those tools during today's episode.
91300	92900	And thirdly, I will include tools,
92900	95300	what we often refer to as protocols,
95300	97340	gleaned from some recent publications.
97340	98940	Indeed, publications that came out
98940	101420	as recently as two weeks ago,
101420	105140	which really emphasize specific things that we can all do
105140	107060	that again are zero cost,
107060	110460	that have been shown in quality peer reviewed research
110460	113520	to significantly improve mood and mental health.
113520	116040	For instance, if you're a regular listener of this podcast,
116040	120520	you are probably familiar with my nearly constant reminder
120520	122520	that people should view morning sunlight
122520	123680	and afternoon sunlight.
123680	126800	And if you can't, to embrace some alternatives
126800	128400	like looking at bright artificial light,
128400	130180	although sunlight is best.
130180	131720	Well, there was a recent paper published
131720	135280	in the journal, Nature Mental Health, an excellent journal,
135280	137720	focusing on not just the positive effects
137720	139440	of viewing light at those times of day
139440	141080	and indeed throughout the day,
141080	144260	but also the independent and positive effects
144260	148280	of being in darkness for six to eight hours every night.
148280	149120	That's right.
149120	151400	Not only is light during the day correlated
151400	154140	with significantly improved mental health outcomes,
154140	156960	but darkness at night that is avoiding lights,
156960	161680	not just bright lights, but lights for up to eight hours
161680	164280	at certain periods of your 24 hour circadian cycle
164280	166920	has been correlated with improved mental health outcomes.
166920	170200	And indeed has been shown to significantly offset
170200	173080	certain negative mental health outcomes.
173080	175200	This is a spectacular study.
175200	178200	Again, it involved a enormous number of research subjects,
178200	180400	more than 85,000 research subjects.
180400	183620	And it touches on a large number of actionable protocols
183620	185780	that I've distilled down to just one or two things
185780	188720	that all of us can easily do to improve our mood
188720	190960	and mental health on a consistent basis.
190960	193680	Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
193680	196440	is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
196440	198740	It is however, part of my desire and effort
198740	201420	to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
201420	204060	and science related tools to the general public.
204060	205140	In keeping with that theme,
205140	207980	I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
207980	210140	Our first sponsor is Plunge.
210140	212620	Plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile
212620	214340	at home self-cooling cold plunge
214340	216220	for deliberate cold exposure.
216220	218740	I've covered the topic of deliberate cold exposure
218740	220220	several times on this podcast.
220220	221660	Indeed, we did an entire episode
221660	223340	about deliberate cold exposure.
223340	226020	And what's very clear from the research literature
226020	228300	is that deliberate cold exposure
228300	231240	can induce dramatic positive shifts
231240	233340	in so-called catecholamines.
233340	236660	That is dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.
236660	238500	This is a small collection of molecules
238500	239920	that are released in the brain and body
239920	241780	when we do deliberate cold exposure.
241780	245300	And that subjectively lead to greatly enhanced feelings
245300	249040	of mood alertness and focus for many hours afterwards.
249040	251540	That's perhaps the best substantiated reason
251540	253120	and the most popular reason
253120	255740	why people who get into deliberate cold exposure,
255740	257040	no pun intended,
257040	259020	continue to do deliberate cold exposure
259020	260340	on a consistent basis.
260340	263060	Plunge uses a powerful and very easy to use
263060	264980	cooling filtration and sanitation unit
264980	266860	to give you access to deliberate cold exposure
266860	268900	in clean water whenever you want.
268900	270780	I've used a Plunge for several years now,
270780	272920	and I really like it because first of all,
272920	274500	it can use a standard outlet.
274500	276080	You don't have to modify the electricity
276080	278940	in your home or yard, and it's very easy to clean.
278940	281540	In fact, it stays clean for long periods of time,
281540	284140	which makes it very easy to maintain as well.
284140	285480	Plunge has several different models
285480	289060	to select from, including their new all-in cold Plunge,
289060	290440	which offers faster cooling,
290440	292700	smartphone connectivity, and more.
292700	294060	If you're interested in getting a Plunge,
294060	299060	you can go to Plunge, spelled P-L-U-N-G-E.com slash Huberman
299580	301600	to get $150 off your cold Plunge.
301600	306040	Again, that's plunge.com slash Huberman to get $150 off.
306040	308900	Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.
308900	311080	8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,
311080	313360	heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
313360	315360	I've spoken many times before in this podcast
315360	316740	about the fact that sleep,
316740	320000	that is getting enough quality sleep on a consistent basis,
320000	321480	is the foundation of mental health,
321480	322840	physical health, and performance.
322840	323680	Now, one of the key things
323680	325720	to getting the best possible night's sleep
325720	328020	is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment,
328020	331020	and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,
331020	332600	your body temperature needs to drop
332600	334360	by about one to three degrees.
334360	337040	And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,
337040	339080	your body temperature actually has to increase
339080	340760	by about one to three degrees.
340760	342400	With 8 Sleep, controlling the temperature
342400	345080	of your sleeping environment is made extremely easy.
345080	347360	8 Sleep mattress covers allow you to program
347360	348680	the temperature of your sleeping environment
348680	350860	at the beginning, middle, and end of your night.
350860	352120	It can even divide the temperature
352120	354080	on the two sides of the bed for different people.
354080	355680	It also has sleep tracking capacity.
355680	357200	It will tell you how much slow wave sleep
357200	358840	and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,
358840	361440	and really help you dial in the exact parameters
361440	363680	so you can get the best possible night's sleep.
363680	365360	I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover
365360	366840	for well over two years now,
366840	369040	and it has significantly improved my sleep,
369040	372240	and therefore my daytime mood focus and alertness.
372240	373520	If you'd like to try 8 Sleep,
373520	376080	you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman
376080	379480	and save up to $150 off their pod three covers.
379480	382040	8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
382040	384080	select countries in the EU, and Australia.
384080	387320	Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.
387320	390360	Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
390360	392120	Waking Up is a meditation app
392120	394280	that includes hundreds of meditation programs,
394280	396680	mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions,
396680	399720	and NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocols.
399720	402040	I started using the Waking Up app a few years ago
402040	404760	because even though I've been doing regular meditation
404760	407840	since my teens, and I started doing yoga nidra
407840	410720	about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me
410720	411960	that he had found an app,
411960	413720	turned out to be the Waking Up app,
413720	416760	which could teach you meditations of different durations
416760	419240	and that had a lot of different types of meditations
419240	421800	to place the brain and body into different states,
421800	423120	and that he liked it very much.
423120	425440	So I gave the Waking Up app a try,
425440	427880	and I too found it to be extremely useful
427880	430920	because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate,
430920	432640	other times I have longer to meditate,
432640	434520	and indeed I love the fact that I can explore
434520	436360	different types of meditation
436360	438560	to bring about different levels of understanding
438560	441120	about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body
441120	442760	into lots of different kinds of states
442760	444760	depending on which meditation I do.
444760	446280	I also love that the Waking Up app
446280	448960	has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions.
448960	450120	For those of you who don't know,
450120	452680	yoga nidra is a process of lying very still,
452680	453960	but keeping an active mind.
453960	456120	It's very different than most meditations,
456120	458200	and there's excellent scientific data
458200	460800	to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it
461360	463480	called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR
463480	466520	can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy
466520	469000	even with just a short 10 minute session.
469000	470920	If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
470920	473800	you can go to wakingup.com slash Huberman
473800	475840	and access a free 30 day trial.
475840	478680	Again, that's wakingup.com slash Huberman
478680	481040	to access a free 30 day trial.
481040	482400	Okay, let's talk about tools
482400	484960	for improving mood and mental health.
484960	486160	I think it goes without saying
486160	489200	that these are extremely important topics
489200	491640	for everyone not just to know about,
491640	495080	but in my opinion, also for people to implement.
495080	496800	And the reason is that we are currently
496800	499800	in a worldwide mental health crisis.
499800	501440	And while we could debate the reason
501440	504000	why we are in a worldwide mental health crisis,
504000	507760	it's very, very clear that mood disorders
507760	509840	and challenges with mental health abound.
509840	511600	And of course, there are many different therapies
511600	514160	for the treatment of mood disorders and mental health,
514160	516240	everything from talk therapy with a psychologist
516240	519640	or a psychiatrist or social worker,
519640	521040	prescription drug treatments,
521040	523680	their nutritional approaches, somatic approaches.
523680	525680	And I want to be clear that I do believe
525680	528040	that there's value in all of these approaches.
528040	531600	What tends to matter in terms of what sorts of tools
531600	536480	and approaches one adopts includes both access,
536480	537720	so whether or not people have access
537720	538680	to these types of therapies,
538680	540920	whether or not they can afford them on a consistent basis,
540920	543160	and also, of course, the severity of the mood
543160	544640	or mental health disorder.
544640	546200	And I'd be remiss, of course,
546200	547400	if I didn't make the statement,
547400	549160	and I don't say this just to protect me,
549160	550880	I also say this to protect all of you
550880	552160	and those that you know,
552160	555000	that if you are concerned about yourself or somebody else
555000	558160	having a serious mood or mental health disorder,
558160	560880	please do seek out help from a licensed clinical psychologist
560880	563320	or psychiatrist or other healthcare professional
563320	566120	who's qualified to help you in that regard.
566120	567920	With that said, we can now have a discussion
567920	570000	about tools and protocols for enhancing mood
570000	572600	and mental health that truly apply to everybody,
572600	574360	regardless of age.
574360	577120	To start off, I wanna talk about a fundamental aspect
577120	579720	of mood and mental health enhancement
579720	581920	that was discussed both in the guest episode
581920	583520	with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,
583520	586640	as well as in the guest series with Dr. Paul Conti.
586640	589880	And that has to do with what Dr. Paul Conti referred to
589880	594400	as the first principles of self-care or mental health.
594400	596400	The first principles of self-care include,
596400	597920	but are not limited to,
597920	600640	taking excellent care of one's biology,
600640	603560	which of course includes both the mind and the body.
603560	606680	And in order to make this very simple and actionable,
606680	610480	I've distilled out what I refer to as the big six.
610480	611640	I've sometimes referred to these
611640	614440	as the six major pillars of health,
614440	616280	both mental health and physical health,
616280	618480	as well as performance for that matter.
618480	620120	But if we're going to talk about tools
620120	621880	for mood and mental health,
621880	626240	we absolutely can't discard discussions about our biology.
626240	629000	That is, we need to make sure that we're taking care
629000	630960	of our normal biological function
630960	633880	and indeed enhancing the production
633880	636920	of specific neurotransmitters and neuromodulators
636920	638360	that we are optimizing.
638360	640240	Yes, I use the word optimizing.
640240	643400	The function of our so-called autonomic nervous system,
643400	644840	that aspect of our nervous system
644840	646880	that's humming in the background all the time.
646880	648160	It's operating unconsciously
648160	650720	to regulate our sleep-wake cycles.
650720	655720	It's regulating how well or poorly we react to things.
655760	659120	It's regulating how much dopamine, serotonin,
659120	661160	epinephrine, acetylcholine we're producing.
661160	663280	All of this stuff is humming in the background
663280	666000	and sets the stage for all the conscious work
666000	668080	that we might put to, for instance,
668080	671480	trying to understand what our life narrative is,
671480	674040	what our unconscious mind is doing,
674040	675880	what sorts of defenses am I producing,
675880	678160	all of the sort of high-level and directed work
678160	679960	that we're going to talk about a little bit later
679960	683240	exists on a background of autonomic function,
683240	686880	of neurotransmitter production, of hormone production,
686880	688360	not just testosterone and estrogen,
688360	691440	but things like cortisol, prolactin and on and on.
691440	693920	So it's important to understand that if our goal
693920	696320	is to be in the best possible mood
696320	697720	given our life circumstances
697720	700520	and to have the best possible mental health
700520	701880	given our life circumstances
701880	704240	and to improve our mood and mental health
704240	705680	consistently over time,
705680	708600	that we have to pay attention to what I'm referring to here
708600	712720	as the big six or the six pillars of mental health.
712720	714760	And those are, just to list them off,
714760	717040	then I'll go into a little bit more detail,
717080	721720	sleep, sunlight, although I'd like to modify sunlight
721720	722960	because based on some new data
722960	724480	that just came out a couple of weeks ago,
724480	728200	I'd like to now make that second pillar,
728200	731680	not sunlight, but light slash dark.
731680	733880	So we could even just think about it as a light,
733880	735360	when and how much light you get.
735360	739040	But what you'll soon learn is that how much dark you get
739040	740680	is also extremely important.
740680	745560	So we've got sleep, light, movement is the third,
745560	749320	nutrition, social connection, and stress control.
749320	752000	Now, these are topics that I've spoken about extensively
752000	754480	on previous Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.
754480	756240	So I don't want to go into a deep dive
756240	758760	of each of these six pillars right now,
758760	761560	but I am going to just give you a few highlights of each.
761560	763120	And then of course, we will provide links
763120	764280	in the show note captions
764280	766480	for which you can go on the deep dive if you like.
766480	767920	And I also would like to mention that
767920	770560	if you ever have questions about specific protocols
770560	772560	or tools and you're seeking those out
772560	775440	to our previous episodes or specific timestamps
775440	777400	of previous episodes of this podcast,
777400	780760	you can go to our newly revamped hubermanlab.com website
780760	782520	and put any topic of interest
782520	785320	or even several topics of interest into the search function.
785320	787760	And it will take you to the very specific timestamps
787760	791800	and other resources that provide information on those topics.
791800	794120	So I'm going to go into a few of the key bullet points
794120	795960	about each of the six pillars,
795960	798160	or what I also refer to as the big six
798160	800040	of self-care and mental health.
800040	804680	Again, this is a necessary list, but is not sufficient.
804680	809240	Again, necessary to do these things every 24 hours,
809240	811240	indeed, every 24 hours,
811240	813460	if you want to have the best possible mood
813460	817000	and mental health, but it is not sufficient.
817000	819760	That means you still need to do some of the other things
819760	821240	that we're going to talk about
821240	823240	in terms of directed approaches
823240	825200	at improving mood and mental health.
825200	827080	If you are to quote unquote,
827080	828800	optimize your mood and mental health,
828800	830160	or if you are, let's just say,
830160	833600	trying to constantly improve your mood and mental health.
833600	835160	But these are the necessary,
835160	838680	but not sufficient pillars of mental health.
838680	840520	So under the heading of sleep,
840520	841960	it's safe to say that most people need
841960	844920	between six to eight hours of sleep per night.
844920	846620	Some people can get away with five.
846620	848880	Some people need as much as nine or 10.
848880	852920	Certainly growing kids, babies, teenagers,
852920	855880	and those that are suffering from some sort of illness
855880	858680	are going to need more, as much as nine, 10,
858680	860980	maybe even 12 hours of sleep per night.
860980	863480	However, most people do well to get somewhere
863480	865920	between six and eight hours of sleep per night.
865920	867420	You're just going to have to experiment
867420	869800	and figure out what's best for you.
869800	870960	Now, one thing I heard recently,
870960	873320	so I can't claim this as an original idea,
873320	876460	but that I think is a really good way to think about sleep,
876460	879220	is that sleep, much like physical fitness,
879220	881920	is something that we have to constantly be working on.
881920	882840	It's not the sort of thing
882840	884560	where you can get a great night's sleep one night,
884560	885600	and then the next night,
885600	887480	just kind of let all the protocols go
887480	889400	and expect to get a great night's sleep.
889400	890600	You don't have to be neurotic
890600	891840	about getting a great night's sleep.
891840	893940	Indeed, I do believe that we should strive
893940	895880	to get enough quality sleep
895880	898160	as many of the nights of our life as possible,
898160	900320	and if you can't do that, hopefully it's for good reasons,
900320	902840	but of course, things happen in life, raising kids,
902840	905120	you have emergencies, all-nighters to study,
905120	907480	so you can make sure you get that best possible grade
907480	908900	on an exam, et cetera, et cetera,
908900	912060	but we should all strive to get the best quality sleep
912060	915340	that we can, and as much of it, most nights of our lives.
915340	917600	So it's important to look at sleep as a process
917600	918940	that you're going to be working on
918940	920940	for the rest of your life, just like fitness,
920940	922380	and I don't say that to overwhelm you,
922380	925360	I say that so that if on any given night
925360	926600	you get a poor night's sleep,
926600	928100	you don't stress that too much,
928100	929580	you just get right back on the wagon
929580	932180	and you try and get the best possible night's sleep
932180	934820	the next night and the next night and the next night,
934820	935820	much like fitness.
935820	937900	There's no 10-week program
937900	941580	that's going to transform your physical fitness forever,
941580	942980	just like there's no sleep program
942980	944600	that's going to transform your sleep forever.
944600	947520	It's a daily or rather, I should say, nightly investment,
947520	948360	although some of the things
948360	950800	that are going to positively impact your sleep
950800	952400	or perhaps damage your sleep
952400	953960	are things that you do during the daytime, right?
953960	955880	So avoid that caffeine too late in the day,
955880	957920	get that morning sunlight and on and on,
957920	959200	but view sleep as something
959200	961240	that you're constantly investing in,
961240	963660	and it is a critical investment
963660	965280	for your mood and mental health.
965280	966800	The other thing that's not often discussed,
966800	968680	and I really haven't talked about terribly much
968680	970360	on this podcast, is the importance
970360	973520	of having a fairly consistent sleep routine.
973520	976320	Now, I realize that not everybody can get to sleep
976320	977880	at the exact same time each night
977880	980040	and wake up at the exact same time each morning,
980040	982160	and frankly, that's not practical.
982160	983560	I certainly don't do that.
983560	987440	However, what we know from the circadian health literature
987440	989400	is that everybody should strive,
989400	991000	again, that's strive, nobody's perfect,
991000	992080	but strive to get to sleep
992080	994400	at more or less the same time each night
994400	997880	and wake up at more or less the same time each morning.
997880	999600	This turns out to be really important
999600	1002080	for regulating mood and mental health,
1002080	1005480	and indeed for improving your overall levels of sleep,
1005480	1008040	getting the optimal amounts of slow wave sleep,
1008040	1010520	aka deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.
1010520	1013000	And what we know is that ideally you're going to get
1013000	1016000	to sleep within plus or minus one hour
1016000	1017280	of your regular sleep time.
1017280	1019680	So if your regular two bed time is 10 o'clock,
1019680	1021120	you're used to getting in bed at 10 o'clock
1021120	1023640	and falling asleep somewhere around 10.30.
1023640	1026760	Well, then if the next night you fall asleep at 9.30, great.
1026760	1029080	You're still within the plus or minus one hour.
1029080	1031520	And if the next night you go to sleep
1031520	1034640	and you don't fall asleep till 11.30, don't sweat it.
1034640	1037360	In fact, you're still within that plus or minus one hour.
1037360	1039680	However, if you start getting into a habit
1039680	1041920	of going to bed at vastly different times,
1041920	1044120	deviating more than or less than one hour
1044120	1046320	from your normal to bed time,
1046320	1048280	well, then you're going to start to run into issues
1048280	1050080	such as waking up feeling groggy,
1050080	1052040	even if you got enough sleep.
1052040	1054000	So even if you slept the full eight hours
1054000	1055000	that you're used to getting,
1055000	1057080	people who go to sleep much later than they normally do
1057080	1058720	or much earlier than they normally do
1058720	1061840	start getting into kind of issues of mood regulation,
1061840	1063640	energy regulation, not just in the morning,
1063640	1064720	but in the afternoon.
1064720	1067440	Likewise, try and wake up at more or less the same time
1067440	1069520	each morning, plus or minus one hour.
1069520	1071240	That's really going to help you anchor
1071240	1072800	your overall sleep schedule.
1072800	1076040	And it's really going to help lead to predictability
1076040	1078520	of your overall levels of energy, mood
1078520	1080040	and focus throughout the day.
1080040	1082880	The second pillar in that big six is light.
1082880	1085480	And I used to refer to this as sunlight, right?
1085480	1087320	I'd say, and I'm going to say it again now,
1087320	1088920	although I've covered this in a lot more detail.
1088920	1092080	So again, just hitting the top contour critical elements,
1092920	1096040	try to view sunlight, that is with your eyes,
1096040	1099720	view sunlight as early as possible after waking.
1099720	1101760	Whenever I say that, the most common question I get is,
1101760	1103800	what do I do if I wake up before the sun comes out?
1103800	1106680	Well, unless you have superpowers that I'm not aware of,
1106680	1108440	you can't make the sun come out any earlier.
1108440	1111320	So just flip on artificial lights as needed
1111320	1114520	until the sun comes out and then get outside,
1114560	1117920	face east in the morning, take off those sunglasses.
1117920	1120600	It's perfectly safe to look at low solar angle sunlight
1120600	1123040	without sunglasses, providing you're not driving
1123040	1125120	into bright light and you crash, this kind of thing.
1125120	1127840	Get outside, look at the sunlight,
1127840	1130840	definitely blink to protect your eyes as needed,
1130840	1133480	but get that sunlight in your eyes early in the day.
1133480	1136600	This has myriad positive effects on mood focus
1136600	1139640	and alertness and nighttime sleep later that night.
1139640	1142520	And it does so through a number of well-defined biological
1142520	1144960	and endocrine hormonal pathways that I've discussed
1144960	1147280	on many previous podcast episodes.
1147280	1149920	And you want to do this for about 10 minutes
1149920	1153720	on non-overcast days and as long as 20 or 30 minutes
1153720	1155240	on overcast days.
1155240	1157560	And that highlights the second most common question I get,
1157560	1160120	which is, what do I do if there's no sun where I live?
1160120	1162040	I live in an area where there's no sunlight.
1162040	1165640	Look, if you live on planet earth, there's always sunlight.
1165640	1167000	There might not be very much of it.
1167000	1168840	That might be very overcast where you live.
1168840	1170320	It might seem very dark, but trust me,
1170320	1173080	there's far more photons, light energy coming
1173080	1174240	through that cloud cover,
1174240	1176880	even in the darkest mornings of winter,
1176880	1180800	than there are at night in those dark winters.
1180800	1182880	So get that light in your eyes
1182880	1184560	and do it as consistently as possible
1184560	1187040	and also do that in the late afternoon and evening.
1187040	1189640	That's critical for regulating your circadian clock
1189640	1191680	for reasons that I've talked about previously,
1191680	1193360	but I'll get into in a future podcast,
1193360	1195360	really explaining how those clock oscillators
1195360	1196640	and mechanisms work.
1196640	1197920	But just to keep it really simple,
1197920	1199640	since this is a toolkit episode
1199640	1201120	for mood and mental health,
1201120	1204920	your mood and your mental health will benefit tremendously
1204920	1206880	from getting morning sunlight in your eyes.
1206880	1209520	Now, if you need to get more light in your eyes,
1209520	1211680	because indeed there's just not enough sunlight
1211680	1214200	or you don't have the opportunity to get outside
1214200	1217360	and view sunlight in the morning for whatever reason,
1217360	1220840	you might invest in getting a bright light source
1220840	1221680	that you can plug in.
1221680	1224760	You probably want one that's as bright as 10,000 lux.
1224760	1226280	So that's pretty bright.
1226280	1228720	Those fall under the category of so-called SAD lamps,
1229200	1231240	seasonal effective disorder lamps.
1231240	1232480	And you can purchase those.
1232480	1234160	They can be somewhat expensive.
1234160	1237580	You can also opt to get a 900 lux drawing tablet.
1237580	1239240	By the way, I have no financial relationship
1239240	1241400	to any of these sorts of light sources,
1241400	1242960	but you can find them pretty easily.
1242960	1246560	And in the case of the 900 lux light tablet,
1246560	1248000	fairly inexpensively online.
1248000	1249380	And you can put that on your desk
1249380	1251640	or where you have your morning coffee
1251640	1253440	and try and enhance the total amount of light
1253440	1255200	that you're getting in the morning.
1255200	1257680	But frankly, nothing is as good as sunlight.
1257680	1258900	So if you can't get sunlight,
1258900	1261640	you might think about investing in one of those SAD lamps.
1261640	1264160	And indeed those SAD lamps aren't as good as sunlight,
1264160	1265480	but they are the next best thing
1265480	1268300	if you really can't get sunlight on a consistent basis.
1268300	1270760	A few other fine points that I always get asked about.
1270760	1273000	First of all, it is absolutely okay
1273000	1275400	to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses.
1275400	1276640	Those sorts of corrective lenses
1276640	1278360	are actually going to focus the light to your retina,
1278360	1279320	which is where you want it.
1279320	1282700	However, this whole process of viewing morning sunlight
1282700	1285240	in afternoon light does not, again,
1285240	1287680	does not work through a window or windshield
1287680	1289320	because windows and windshields
1289320	1291360	filter out the relevant wavelengths of light
1291360	1293680	that you want to get directly onto your retina.
1293680	1295800	Okay, so that's the reality of it.
1295800	1297360	In addition, please don't feel
1297360	1299120	that you have to look directly at the sun
1299120	1301080	and certainly don't stare at the sun.
1301080	1303040	Never force yourself to look at any light,
1303040	1304140	sunlight or otherwise,
1304140	1306440	that's so bright that it's painful to look at.
1306440	1309000	So if it's comfortable for you to look directly at the sun
1309000	1310200	and just blink every once in a while
1310200	1312300	and you can do that without any pain or discomfort
1312300	1314320	or watering of the eyes, please do that.
1314320	1316880	You're getting a lot of photons into your eyes
1316880	1318400	and they're transmitting that to your brain
1318400	1320920	and your brain to the rest of your body and on and on.
1320920	1322380	However, if you find it uncomfortable
1322380	1323720	to look directly at the sun,
1323720	1326560	in that case, what you'll want to do is offset your gaze
1326560	1328880	to 10 or 20 degrees, which is nerd speak
1328880	1330160	for just a little bit to the right
1330160	1331560	or a little bit to the left
1331560	1335000	and get the sunlight into your eyes indirectly.
1335000	1337480	Okay, and I often also get asked,
1337480	1339200	well, can I stand in the shade while I do this?
1339200	1341580	What if I have an overhang in my apartment?
1341580	1343400	The best thing is of course going to be
1343400	1344880	to face directly to the sun
1344880	1347480	and look either directly at it or slightly offset.
1347480	1349620	But if you can only get morning sunlight
1349620	1351160	by going out onto your balcony
1351160	1353960	and your balcony doesn't face east, rather it faces west,
1353960	1356320	you'll still get a lot of photons from the sun
1356320	1357480	reaching your eyes there.
1357480	1361960	But ideally you would find some way to look toward the sun
1361960	1363020	first thing in the morning.
1363020	1365180	I realized that with kids and work and other obligations,
1365180	1366180	this can be challenging,
1366180	1369580	but it is a challenge worth meeting.
1369580	1371320	Meaning don't lose your job
1371320	1373180	or forget to take care of your kids to do this,
1373180	1375180	but you can bring your kids to do this.
1375180	1378280	And indeed you should, it sets their circadian rhythms also.
1378280	1381660	And people often will ask, well, does it work on dogs?
1381660	1383940	You know, and indeed dogs and other animals
1383940	1385740	have these exact same circuits and pathways
1385740	1387200	for setting their circadian rhythm.
1387200	1388780	So it's great for them too.
1388780	1391520	Now there are also clear and documented benefits
1391520	1392620	for mood and mental health
1392620	1394020	to getting bright light in your eyes,
1394020	1396340	ideally from sunlight throughout the day,
1396340	1397600	as much as you safely can.
1397600	1399180	Please don't get sunburned,
1399180	1402500	don't get cataracts by getting too much sunlight,
1402500	1404580	but getting outdoors and getting sunlight in your eyes
1404580	1407140	during your lunch break or a walk here and there,
1407140	1410060	or if you have to remain indoors during the day,
1410060	1413280	getting the lights in that environment as bright as possible
1413280	1415120	as is safely possible, I should say,
1415120	1417800	is known to improve mood and mental health.
1417800	1418640	Why?
1418640	1421240	Well, because there's a special so-called opsin
1421240	1423900	within the cells of your eyes called melanopsin
1423900	1427580	that doesn't respond to the same differences in color
1427580	1430220	that are present in sunlight in the morning and the evening,
1430220	1433540	but rather responds to the overall brightness of light.
1433540	1436180	So very bright lights, either from artificial sources
1436180	1438660	or ideally from sunlight, activate these cells
1438660	1441180	and these cells project these little wires,
1441180	1443820	we call axons, into specific parts of the brain
1443820	1446980	that improve your mood and feelings of wellbeing.
1446980	1450660	So I can't give you a specific number
1450660	1452680	of five minutes a day or 10 minutes a day.
1452680	1454300	Just get as much light in your eyes,
1454300	1456260	ideally from sunlight throughout the day,
1456260	1457740	as is safe for you,
1457740	1459260	meaning where you're not getting sunburned
1459260	1460820	and you're not damaging your retina.
1460820	1463120	And if you want to know if you're damaging your retina,
1463120	1465820	well, anytime you have to blink or turn away from light
1465820	1466860	because it's really bright,
1466860	1468900	that's a signal that the light is too bright.
1468900	1471580	So while you want to place yourself into bright environments,
1471580	1473620	you don't want to place yourself into any environment
1473620	1475620	so bright that it's painful to be in.
1475620	1478460	Okay, so use that as a metric and you should be just fine.
1478460	1481060	And the last point about light for mood and mental health
1481060	1482900	is a relatively recent theme
1482900	1484860	that's emerging from the scientific literature
1484860	1487660	and that really was driven home by a recent study
1487660	1489260	that I mentioned a little bit earlier in the episode.
1489260	1491540	This is the study published in Nature Mental Health,
1491540	1494900	showing that darkness during a particular stage
1494900	1496460	of your 24 hour cycle,
1496460	1498260	your so-called circadian rhythm,
1498260	1502300	is also very beneficial for mood and mental health.
1502300	1504720	And it's beneficial for mood and mental health
1504720	1509060	in a way that is independent from light and from sleep.
1509060	1510260	Now, what do I mean by that?
1510260	1511940	Okay, well, there are a number of different ways
1511940	1513180	that this can be examined,
1513180	1516980	but in this particular study, which I like oh so much,
1516980	1519580	entitled Day and Night Light Exposure
1519580	1521980	are Associated with Psychiatric Disorders,
1521980	1525900	an objective light study in more than 85,000 people.
1525900	1530060	What the researchers did is they analyzed how much light
1530060	1533780	and or dark people were getting across the 24 hour cycle
1533780	1536860	and correlated that with mental health outcomes,
1536860	1539220	looking at a range of different mental health challenges,
1539220	1541900	including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression,
1541900	1543820	PTSD, and much more.
1543820	1546300	And I'll go into this study in a lot of detail
1546300	1547220	in a future episode,
1547220	1548580	cause it's such an important study
1548580	1551180	with so many gems within it that we should all know about.
1551180	1553680	But one of the key things from this study
1553680	1558180	is that the positive effects of daytime sunlight exposure
1558180	1562340	and the positive effects of nighttime dark exposure,
1562340	1564940	that means of course the absence of light,
1564940	1567300	are independent of one another.
1567300	1570980	Put differently, making sure that you're in very dim
1570980	1573640	to completely dark environments
1573640	1576760	for a continuous six to eight hours
1576760	1579620	within every 24 hours circadian cycle
1579620	1583040	is correlated with much better mental health outcomes.
1583040	1585720	In other words, we shouldn't just think about
1585720	1588080	the presence of light in the morning
1588080	1590040	and throughout the day as positive for mental health.
1590040	1592160	That's all true, it's absolutely true.
1592160	1593800	And this study further verifies that,
1593800	1595280	but that's been known for some time,
1595280	1598200	indeed decades from the scientific research.
1598200	1600420	And of course it's been known for thousands of years
1600420	1602080	intuitively and subjectively
1602080	1605380	without detailed scientific measurement.
1605380	1606880	But in addition to that,
1606880	1611160	this study shows that people who stay in very dim
1611160	1615560	to dark environments for eight hours every 24 hours,
1615560	1617920	or I should say approximately eight hours
1617920	1619900	in every 24 hour cycle,
1619900	1623080	they benefit from improved mood and mental health outcomes
1623080	1625740	in a way that's independent of how much light they're getting
1625740	1629300	and independent of how much sleep they are getting.
1629300	1631320	The point is this, the time when you wake up,
1631320	1633160	consider that time zero.
1633160	1634720	And then about, again,
1634720	1636500	you don't have to be super strict about this,
1636500	1640720	about 16 to 24 hours after that wake up time,
1640720	1643340	you should be in a very dim to dark environment
1643340	1648340	for that 16 hour to 24 hour period after waking up, okay?
1648640	1649760	What do I mean by this?
1649760	1651940	I mean, if you go to sleep at 10 PM
1651940	1654120	and you wake up at 6 AM,
1654120	1657460	well that 10 PM to 6 AM phase of your circadian cycle,
1657460	1659280	you should be in very dim light
1659280	1662180	or entirely dark environment.
1662180	1664320	This is a great opportunity to reference another study
1664320	1666120	which was published in the proceedings
1666120	1667440	of the National Academy of Sciences,
1667440	1669840	which shows that even having a small amount
1669840	1672920	of light in the room, which isn't even that bright,
1672920	1675000	while you're sleeping with eyes closed
1675000	1677800	can disrupt morning glucose levels.
1677800	1681520	So in other words, keep your sleeping environment dark,
1681520	1683440	keep your nighttime environment dim
1683440	1685960	to the best of your abilities, right?
1685960	1687960	Certainly go out to dinner every once in a while,
1687960	1690780	go to the movies, go out and have a party, enjoy yourself.
1690780	1692520	If you have to go to the hospital, God forbid,
1692520	1695040	or you have to tend to some emergency, do that.
1695040	1697200	But to the extent that you can control it
1697200	1700360	within the confines of life and its demands,
1700360	1703760	keep your nighttime environment dim or dark
1703760	1706320	because that independently of any sunlight
1706320	1707680	and other bright light that you're viewing
1707680	1709500	during the daytime and afternoon
1709500	1713460	is going to positively improve your mood and mental health.
1713460	1714920	Now moving on to the other pillars
1714920	1717280	and these I'm going to move through a bit more quickly
1717280	1718440	than I have the previous two
1718440	1720940	because we've done entire series on these,
1720940	1723480	or I should say seriesies, seriesies?
1723480	1724320	Is that how you pronounce it?
1724320	1726160	Someone put the plural of seriesies
1726160	1729440	in the comments on YouTube.
1729440	1730920	The third pillar is movement.
1730920	1733320	And when I say movement, I mean exercise.
1733320	1736460	As you all know, we should all strive to get anywhere
1736460	1741060	from 180 to 220 minutes of zone two cardio per week.
1741060	1744520	That's movement that allows you to hold a conversation,
1744520	1747200	but were you to do it more intensely,
1747200	1748400	or even a bit more intensely,
1748400	1750080	you wouldn't be able to hold that conversation.
1750080	1752280	In addition, we should do some VO2 max work.
1752280	1754200	We should get our heart rate very high
1754200	1755320	at least once a week,
1755320	1756920	doing some sort of movement that's safe for you.
1756920	1759160	So that could be running or cycling or swimming
1759160	1760960	or Pilates, whatever it is for you,
1760960	1764280	getting your heart rate way, way up is also important.
1764280	1765880	And to do that at least once a week,
1765880	1768400	but daily movement, either cardiovascular training
1768400	1769520	or resistance training.
1769520	1771840	And it's very, very clear that we need both,
1771840	1773180	maybe not on the same days.
1773180	1775360	In fact, I split them to separate days.
1775360	1779200	Resistance training done for anywhere from six to 10 sets
1779200	1782280	per muscle group, either close to or to failure.
1782280	1784080	This could be with weights, it could be with bands,
1784080	1785360	it could be with machines.
1785360	1788800	All of that was covered in detail in the podcast series
1788800	1791880	that I did with Dr. Andy Galpin, an exercise physiologist
1791880	1793180	who's expert in all those areas.
1793180	1796900	I also did an episode on a foundational fitness protocol
1796900	1801360	that has been distilled into a very simple three page PDF
1801360	1803440	that you can get for completely zero cost
1803440	1805000	by going to hubermanlab.com
1805000	1807120	and just put foundational fitness protocol PDF
1807120	1808600	and you'll be taken to that toolkit.
1808600	1811960	So all of the details of a weekly exercise routine
1811960	1815800	that involves daily movement, but also certainly in my case
1815800	1818560	includes at least one full day of rest per week,
1818560	1820580	because many people do indeed need one,
1820580	1823040	maybe even two full days of rest per week.
1823040	1825280	So that highlights the third pillar movement,
1825280	1827480	but we know that cardiovascular training
1827480	1829840	and resistance training aren't just great for our body.
1829840	1832600	They also improve mood and mental health.
1832600	1835400	That's so very clear from the research literature.
1835400	1838280	So we can't overlook those in a conversation
1838280	1839860	about mood and mental health.
1839860	1842040	Now the fourth pillar is nutrition.
1842040	1843560	And nutrition is a big topic.
1843560	1844960	It's a very barbed wire topic.
1844960	1847240	If you get involved in this stuff online,
1847240	1849840	you know, you've got your people who believe that,
1849840	1851600	you know, carnivore is better than vegan.
1851600	1852760	You have the people who believe vegan
1852760	1853680	is better than carnivore.
1853680	1854880	Most people are omnivores.
1854880	1857320	You have your seed oil debates and on and on and on.
1857320	1859240	We're not going to touch any of that now.
1859240	1862200	Indeed, if you want to learn more about nutrition
1862200	1863800	and what works and what doesn't work
1863800	1865960	for sake of aesthetic changes, weight loss,
1865960	1866880	muscle gain, et cetera,
1866880	1869280	I would refer you to the guest episode
1869280	1871360	that we did with Dr. Lane Norton.
1871360	1873160	You can find that again at hubermanlab.com
1873160	1875320	where we do a deep dive on all the variations
1875320	1877480	and different nutritional protocols.
1877480	1880300	But suffice to say that regardless of whether or not
1880300	1883100	you're vegan, omnivore, carnivore, or keto or whatever,
1884060	1886640	everybody needs to consume sufficient amounts,
1886640	1890380	but not excess amounts of quality calories per day.
1890380	1892040	Now you may do that by intermittent fasting.
1892040	1894720	You may do that by a more traditional meal scheduling,
1894720	1897880	but everybody's going to need to do that
1897880	1899680	because your body and brain,
1899680	1902360	and indeed the parts of your body and brain
1902360	1905760	that translate to mood and mental health
1905760	1907840	require macronutrients,
1907840	1909200	proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,
1909200	1910480	as well as micronutrients.
1910480	1912420	So the key takeaway with nutrition
1912420	1914400	is to make it quality nutrition
1914400	1917160	within the bounds of whatever sort of nutritional program
1917160	1918040	that you're following.
1918040	1921880	And that means getting most of your food sources
1921880	1925280	from either non-processed or minimally processed foods.
1925280	1927520	So these will be foods that you're going to need to prepare
1927520	1930720	or foods that would perish over time.
1930720	1932600	These are not the sorts of foods that live in boxes
1932600	1934360	and cans and other packages
1934360	1935800	that would allow them to live on the shelves
1935800	1937120	forever and ever.
1937120	1939520	Okay, and as I say that, I know many people are shouting,
1939520	1940880	well, what about rice?
1940880	1942540	Rice can live on the shelf for a long time.
1942540	1946520	And yes, okay, I consider rice a minimally processed food
1946520	1948080	because of course it can live on the shelf
1948080	1949000	for a long period of time.
1949000	1951560	And here I'm just going to back out of the whole conversation
1951560	1952800	about nutrition at this point,
1952800	1955160	because as you can probably tell,
1955160	1958800	it's a deep series of rabbit holes that we can fall into
1958800	1959760	and really get distracted.
1959760	1962280	The point is make sure you're getting enough food.
1962280	1963240	Don't overeat.
1963240	1966320	We know energy toxicity is a problem
1966320	1969120	for not just body composition, but for mental health.
1969120	1972520	So you want to get enough calories, but not too few calories.
1972520	1974160	And you'll want to make sure that you're getting them
1974160	1975640	from quality sources.
1975640	1976840	And I say that because of course,
1976840	1980000	food is not just the substrate for the seller repair
1980000	1982740	and indeed production of tissues in your body,
1982740	1985260	but it's also the substrate for all the sorts
1985260	1986920	of neurotransmitters, right?
1986920	1989040	Which are derived from amino acid precursors
1989040	1991080	that are derived from food, right?
1991080	1993560	All of that dopamine stuff and serotonin stuff
1993560	1996160	is derived from amino acids that come from food sources.
1996160	1998900	So the link between nutrition and mental health
1998900	2000480	should now be an obvious one.
2000480	2003040	As we all know, quality nutrition influences,
2003040	2004200	of course, our physical health,
2004200	2006920	but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning,
2006920	2009840	our memory, our ability to learn new things and to focus.
2009840	2012020	And we know that one of the most important features
2012020	2013960	of high quality nutrition is making sure
2013960	2015960	that we get enough vitamins and minerals
2015960	2019560	from high quality, unprocessed or minimally processed sources,
2019560	2022680	as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber
2022680	2025740	to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,
2025740	2027600	including the gut microbiome.
2027600	2029720	Now, I, like most everybody,
2029720	2032780	try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,
2032780	2036960	ideally mostly from minimally processed or non-processed foods.
2036960	2038440	However, one of the challenges that I
2038440	2039920	and so many other people face
2039920	2042000	is getting enough servings of high quality fruits
2042000	2044940	and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics
2044940	2047140	that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.
2047140	2049180	That's why way back in 2012,
2049180	2053040	long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.
2053040	2054620	And so I'm delighted that AG1
2054620	2056780	is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.
2056780	2058520	The reason I started taking AG1
2058520	2061800	and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day
2061800	2064600	is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.
2064600	2066560	That is, it provides insurance
2066560	2068920	that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins,
2068920	2070960	minerals, probiotics, and fiber
2070960	2073000	to ensure optimal mental health,
2073000	2075200	physical health, and performance.
2075200	2076600	If you'd like to try AG1,
2076600	2079880	you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman
2079880	2081440	to claim a special offer.
2081440	2083200	They're giving away five free travel packs
2083200	2086040	plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
2086040	2089360	Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman
2089360	2091240	to claim that special offer.
2091240	2093760	The fifth pillar in the big six is social connection.
2093760	2095120	And we're going to talk a little bit more
2095120	2096740	about this later in the episode,
2096740	2099320	but let's just be very brief and specific about this.
2099320	2102580	We all need to strive to limit the number
2102580	2106280	of social interactions that we feel tax
2106280	2109000	or even vex us that cause us stress.
2109000	2111720	This is something that was covered in depth
2111720	2113540	in the episode with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,
2113540	2115080	where she talked about the fact
2115080	2116700	that we don't just have a nervous system
2116700	2119080	that regulates itself through experience
2119080	2121760	and through our thoughts and our actions.
2121760	2125400	We are, as a species, interacting with other nervous systems,
2125400	2127760	both of our own species, other humans,
2127760	2130240	as well as non-human species, dogs and cats,
2130240	2132600	and if you have them, horses and other animals.
2132600	2134240	So we need to think about our nervous system
2134240	2136320	as being both regulated from the inside
2136320	2138760	and through our own actions and choices and thoughts,
2138760	2141800	but also through interaction with other nervous systems.
2141800	2144200	And while we don't always have as much control
2144200	2147600	over which social interactions or work interactions
2147600	2149280	we have to engage in,
2149280	2152080	we should really strive to understand
2152080	2154260	and indeed pay some serious attention
2154260	2157400	to whether or not certain types of social interactions
2157400	2161420	are what she referred to as net savings,
2161420	2164040	neutral or taxing, right?
2164040	2165680	Certain types of social interactions
2165680	2167480	with certain people or groups of people
2167480	2168760	just make us feel taxed.
2168760	2170520	It makes us feel stressed.
2170520	2173600	It leads to negative affect.
2173600	2176720	That is not good feelings or emotions
2176720	2179520	and often elevated levels of autonomic arousal
2179520	2180800	that leave us ruminating
2180800	2182480	and leave us having challenges with sleep.
2182480	2185680	We really should all strive to limit those interactions
2185680	2187280	to the extent that we can.
2187280	2188520	On the reverse side of that,
2188520	2191760	as Lisa Feldman Barrett so beautifully pointed out,
2191760	2192980	we also have the capability
2192980	2194820	to regulate each other's nervous systems
2194820	2197080	in ways that produce savings,
2197080	2199400	that is, that allow us to feel
2199400	2202040	and indeed cause physiological changes
2202040	2205360	that make us feel not just happier, not just relaxed,
2205360	2208840	not just happy because we enjoy interacting with somebody
2208840	2212500	but we're a group, but that give us a savings,
2212500	2214360	that give us the kind of resources,
2214360	2216960	literally metabolic and neurochemical resources
2216960	2218640	that make us feel more capable
2218640	2220480	and give us a sense of elevated mood
2220480	2221580	and improved mental health
2221580	2224000	when we are not engaging with those people.
2224000	2225760	And this is highly subjective, of course,
2225760	2227240	but you should be able to distinguish.
2227240	2229880	In fact, I encourage you to spend a little bit of time,
2229880	2231520	maybe even just five or 10 minutes,
2231520	2234160	thinking about who are the individuals and groups
2234160	2237840	that I interact with that leave me feeling taxed,
2237840	2240080	that really seem to drain my energy
2240080	2243040	and have me ruminating and in a not good space
2243040	2245400	when I leave whatever interaction I had with them.
2245400	2248160	This could be a real interaction or an online interaction.
2248160	2250680	Indeed, I did this the other day based on Lisa's suggestion.
2250680	2253040	I found it to be tremendously useful.
2253040	2255640	What I did is I decided to,
2255640	2257400	and by the way, this was happening on a run
2257400	2258620	where I was thinking,
2258620	2261600	a lot of my mind is in a conversation with people
2261600	2262640	that aren't even here.
2262640	2265600	I was sort of working through a conversation.
2265600	2267080	I was thinking about what I would say,
2267080	2269280	what I did say, what they said,
2269280	2272480	in an interaction that unfortunately was pretty unpleasant.
2272480	2273800	It wasn't extremely unpleasant,
2273800	2274800	but it was pretty unpleasant.
2274800	2278040	And I realized, okay, that is a sort of interaction
2278040	2279560	that I would like to avoid in the future
2279560	2281380	because it wasn't happening right then,
2281380	2284420	but it was carried forward into a portion of my day,
2284420	2287880	my morning run that for me is normally very pleasurable
2287880	2290040	and quite sacred to me, actually.
2290040	2291520	So paying some attention
2291520	2293960	to how much of your internal dialogue is with yourself
2293960	2296160	versus with others and how much of that is positive
2296160	2298440	or negative is extremely beneficial.
2298440	2300920	And I'm not talking about always just thinking about oneself
2300920	2302040	and not thinking about others.
2302040	2304500	To the contrary, we also need to think,
2304500	2306600	as Lisa pointed out,
2306600	2309940	about who are the people with whom we interact with
2309940	2314400	or observe that lead us to have ongoing dialogue with them
2314400	2316520	in our mind or think about those interactions
2316520	2318200	in ways that give us energy,
2318200	2320220	that lead to energetic savings,
2320220	2322540	literally metabolic savings that we can apply,
2322540	2324580	not just in those interactions,
2324580	2327620	but in our work endeavors and our solo endeavors,
2327620	2328460	whatever that we're doing
2328460	2329880	when we are away from those people.
2329880	2334880	So while this concept of savings or neutral or taxation
2336200	2338940	of our metabolic and our neurochemical systems
2338940	2341380	might seem a little bit squishy, it is not squishy.
2341380	2343900	This is a neurobiological concept.
2343900	2345620	It's also a psychological concept.
2345620	2347760	And it's one that I'm so glad that Lisa brought up
2347760	2351800	because social connection, social interaction is so vital
2351800	2353400	to our mood and mental health.
2353400	2355880	But oftentimes we hear social connection and we think,
2355880	2357840	oh, that means we have to spend a lot of time with friends.
2357840	2359560	We have to organize dinner parties.
2359560	2362680	Well, sure, that's all fine and good if you can do that.
2362680	2364720	And I do, of course, encourage people to spend time
2364720	2365680	with those that they love,
2365680	2368580	but it's also important to take a step back
2368580	2371240	and just think a bit, maybe even write out a bit,
2371240	2373400	who are the groups and sorts of individuals
2373400	2374760	and interactions that really tax you?
2374760	2376880	Who are the people that you find kind of neutral?
2376880	2378440	And what are the individuals and groups
2378440	2381360	that really provide what Lisa referred to as savings?
2381360	2383200	That is, they tap into the metabolic
2383200	2384880	and neurochemical pathways that lead us
2384880	2386840	to have improved mood and mental health,
2386840	2388580	not just during those interactions,
2388580	2390820	but away from those interactions as well,
2390820	2394440	and often pervasively and extremely positively so.
2394440	2397020	So this is no small deal.
2397020	2400220	This is a really important aspect of our mental health.
2400220	2404540	Now, the sixth pillar in the big six is stress control.
2404540	2407340	And the reason it's included is that,
2407340	2409780	look, stress is going to happen.
2409780	2412860	Life is filled with so-called stressors.
2412860	2415780	And for a good number of years, in fact, the last 15 years,
2415780	2418380	there's been a lot of debate in the field of psychology
2418380	2419340	and neuroscience as well,
2419340	2421140	whether or not stress is good for us,
2421140	2422420	whether or not stress is bad for us,
2422420	2424340	whether or not we simply need to reframe stress
2424340	2425180	as good or bad.
2425180	2427420	And to some extent, all of that is true.
2427420	2429780	We know that chronic stress is not good for our memory,
2429780	2431580	our immune system, or our health.
2431580	2434700	We also know that if you understand the reality,
2434700	2437620	which is that stress also allows us to harness our mental
2437620	2440700	and physical resources to perform better than we would
2440700	2442580	otherwise in certain circumstances,
2442580	2445220	and that provided we can get to sleep each night,
2445220	2446940	that perhaps stress isn't so bad,
2446940	2449180	and perhaps is even performance enhancing.
2449180	2451700	I talked about this in the guest episode
2451700	2455380	with Dr. Ali Krum from the psychology department at Stanford,
2455380	2457940	and I've talked about this in other podcasts as well.
2457940	2461060	And I'm not here to tell you that stress is good for you.
2461060	2462740	I'm not here to tell you that stress is bad for you.
2462740	2465340	What I am going to tell you is that it is extremely important
2465340	2469460	that we all have readily accessible stress management tools
2469460	2471380	that work the first time and every time.
2471380	2472860	And these fall into two categories.
2472860	2475140	The first category are real time tools.
2475140	2477740	So tools that you can use to reduce your level of stress
2477740	2478700	in real time.
2478700	2481780	And the best way that I'm aware of that's grounded
2481780	2484900	in excellent physiology and neuroscience
2484900	2486820	to reduce your stress in real time
2486820	2488740	is the so-called physiological side.
2488740	2490700	I did not invent this pattern of breathing.
2490700	2492660	It's not breath work per se.
2492660	2494740	This is a pattern of breathing that we all naturally do
2494740	2497700	in our sleep to restore carbon dioxide and oxygen levels
2497700	2499220	to their proper ratios.
2499220	2500940	We also do it periodically throughout the day
2500940	2501900	without noticing.
2501900	2505260	Indeed, we have a defined or specific neural circuit
2505260	2507420	in our brain that extends to our diaphragm
2507420	2511380	and communicates with aspects of our heart, et cetera,
2511380	2515380	that allow physiological size to calm us down faster,
2515380	2518820	at least to my knowledge, than any other directed protocol.
2518820	2520860	And the physiological side, as many of you know,
2520860	2522700	is very simple and straightforward.
2522700	2524060	Anyone can do this.
2524060	2527020	You simply do a big inhale through your nose,
2527020	2529620	try and maximize the inflation of your lungs.
2529620	2531580	And then before you exhale,
2531580	2533660	sneak in another brief inhalation,
2533660	2535620	even if it's just a tiny micro inhalation
2535620	2538060	to maximally inflate the lungs.
2538060	2540340	And that has an important effect on the little sacs
2540340	2542420	in the lungs called the avioli of the lungs.
2542420	2545340	It's going to open up whatever avioli were collapsed
2545340	2546180	in there.
2546180	2549260	And then you're going to do a long extended exhale
2549260	2550500	through the mouth.
2550500	2552300	And typically just one,
2552300	2553900	although sometimes it requires two or three,
2553900	2557540	but just one physiological sigh is effective
2557540	2560100	in bringing down one's level of stress
2560100	2562860	significantly enough that you don't need to do it again.
2562860	2565500	So this can be done essentially anywhere and by anyone.
2565500	2568060	I suppose you probably couldn't do it if you were underwater
2568060	2570580	or certainly don't do it if you're underwater,
2570580	2573540	but otherwise it's a very safe and very effective way
2573540	2575740	to calm down and reduce your levels of stress
2575740	2577940	in real time, maybe before public speaking
2577940	2580340	or in whatever circumstance you feel you need to calm down
2580340	2581580	in real time.
2581580	2583940	So I'll demonstrate the physiological sigh for you here.
2583940	2586780	I've done this many times before in previous episodes,
2586780	2588180	but for those of you that haven't heard
2588180	2589580	or seen those episodes,
2589580	2592220	I feel obligated to do it again now.
2592220	2593980	Okay, so it's a deep inhale through the nose
2593980	2595740	followed by another brief inhale through the nose
2595740	2597300	and then a long exhale through the mouth.
2597300	2599100	And before you start asking questions about,
2599100	2600700	what do I do if I have a deviated septum?
2600700	2602060	Can it be just through the mouth?
2602060	2603940	Do the first two through the nose,
2603940	2605740	do the third through the mouth.
2605740	2606700	So it's like this.
2617140	2618860	And indeed I feel calmer.
2618860	2621420	And indeed, if you do it, you will feel calmer.
2621420	2623220	You'll notice that second inhale through the nose
2623220	2627060	was kind of sharp in the sense that I had to really push,
2627060	2629100	put some physical effort into making it happen.
2629100	2631180	And my shoulders jolted upwards
2631180	2632740	if you're just listening to this
2632740	2634700	and not watching my shoulders jolted upwards.
2634700	2637380	That second inhale through the nose is important
2637380	2639460	for a variety of reasons I've talked about elsewhere.
2639460	2641900	So the physiological sigh is going to be
2641900	2643620	the go-to protocol for you.
2643620	2645060	Again, not invented by me.
2645060	2646300	This is not Huberman breathing.
2646300	2649660	This is a pattern of breathing discovered in the 1930s
2649660	2650620	by physiologists.
2650620	2652420	It's hardwired into our nervous system.
2652420	2653580	And that's what makes it so great.
2653580	2656380	It works the first time and it works every time.
2656380	2657860	So that's, to my knowledge,
2657860	2661580	the best way to control your stress in real time.
2661580	2664300	Now, why is that important for mood and mental health?
2664300	2666580	Well, as we'll talk about later,
2666580	2669300	if you want to access your so-called generative drive,
2669300	2671580	a theme that we're going to get into in a bit more detail,
2671580	2673580	this is something that came up during the series
2673580	2675020	with Dr. Paul Conti,
2675020	2678180	you will learn that stress and anger and negative emotions,
2678180	2681100	while they can be very motivating, very arousing,
2681100	2683580	they are not going to be good
2683580	2687500	for your long-term mood and mental health, period.
2687500	2689980	So having tools to regulate your stress
2689980	2692460	and your levels of anger, your levels of reactivity,
2692460	2694860	and also to elevate your feelings of agency
2694860	2696100	and control over your life,
2696100	2699500	starting with agency and control over your physiology,
2699500	2702420	your internal state, is going to be vital.
2702420	2704300	And what I love about the physiological side
2704300	2706380	is that, of course, it's completely zero cost,
2706380	2710060	but also there's a dedicated circuit in your brain and body
2710060	2712500	for this particular pattern of breathing.
2712500	2715820	We do it spontaneously, but you can do it intentionally
2715820	2718100	and it works just as well, if not better,
2718100	2719780	to regulate your levels of stress.
2719780	2721580	That is to bring them down,
2721580	2723740	which has outsized positive effects
2723740	2725820	on your mood and mental health, not just in the moment,
2725820	2728860	but it also should improve your confidence
2728860	2731060	that when stress comes,
2731060	2733300	because the world is filled with stressors, it's not if,
2733300	2734940	it's when, when stress comes
2734940	2737020	that you will have a physiologically,
2737020	2739420	scientifically supported tool to deal with
2739420	2741060	and reduce that stress.
2741060	2742940	Now, in addition, I do believe it's important
2742940	2744900	for sake of mood and mental health
2744900	2748420	to also have a tool or a protocol
2748420	2750500	to raise your stress threshold.
2750500	2752220	That is to increase your capacity
2752220	2753660	to deal with life stressors
2753660	2756260	without them feeling so stressful.
2756260	2757700	And there are a number of different ways to do this,
2757700	2760140	but they all center around elevating your levels
2760140	2763660	of adrenaline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine,
2763660	2765420	noradrenaline, those are the same thing,
2765420	2767100	just they have multiple names, forgive me.
2767100	2768900	I didn't give the same two things four names,
2768900	2772380	so don't blame me, blame the other scientists that did it.
2772380	2775220	The point is, there are several ways
2775220	2777780	that you can self-induce elevations
2777780	2781220	of noradrenaline and adrenaline,
2781220	2784180	and then to learn to anchor your mind
2784180	2785620	and your thinking to stay calm
2785620	2787540	in those elevated adrenaline states
2787540	2790140	as a practice for when stressors hit you
2790140	2791300	in the outside world
2791300	2793940	and your adrenaline and noradrenaline spike.
2793940	2796700	Now, one of the best ways to do this,
2796700	2798940	because it works the first time and every time
2798940	2802500	and is also zero cost, in fact, it will save you money,
2802500	2805660	is to put yourself in a cold shower
2805660	2808460	or other deliberate cold exposure environment,
2808460	2811300	but most everyone has access to a cold shower,
2811300	2813060	not everyone, but most people.
2813060	2814820	And of course, by turning off the heat,
2814820	2817740	you're going to reduce heating costs, right, your water bill.
2817740	2821780	So getting into a cold shower for a minute or so
2821780	2823220	to elevate your levels of adrenaline
2823220	2825100	and learning to either use your breathing,
2825100	2826900	you could do physiological size,
2826900	2828620	or to distract yourself,
2828620	2830940	or whatever tools and approaches you need
2830940	2833300	to be able to stay calm
2833300	2836500	while you have elevated levels of adrenaline in your body.
2836500	2839020	And the reason deliberate cold exposure works so well
2839020	2842860	to do this is that it is pretty non-negotiable.
2842860	2845500	Even if you really love cold showers or cold plunges
2845500	2847220	or things of that sort,
2847220	2850060	you're still going to get that elevated adrenaline
2850060	2851260	and noradrenaline.
2851260	2854020	It's pretty much non-negotiable.
2854020	2855340	For the first 10 or 15 seconds
2855340	2857180	that you get into a cold plunge or a cold shower,
2857180	2859860	you should fully expect yourself to feel stressed
2859860	2861420	and for your breathing to accelerate.
2861420	2863260	And then your goal is to try and anchor
2863260	2865980	or control your breathing in that stressful environment.
2865980	2868420	The reason for doing this is that it's a practice.
2868420	2870420	It's a practice that's going to translate
2870420	2873260	to a better ability to manage your internal state,
2873260	2875500	and therefore your thinking, your cognition,
2875500	2878460	and your ability to make good decisions under stress.
2878460	2882180	It's not about becoming untouched by stress.
2882180	2885260	It's about being able to better navigate stress.
2885260	2888780	Indeed, I think of this as analogous to driving in fog,
2888780	2889940	something that I had to learn to do
2889940	2891140	because I grew up in the Bay Area
2891140	2893340	and it can be very foggy there sometimes.
2893340	2895340	And of course you don't learn to drive in fog
2895340	2896700	the first day you learn how to drive,
2896700	2899220	but the first time you hit heavy fog driving
2899220	2900740	where you can only see one reflector
2900740	2903740	in front of you at a time, it is truly stressful, right?
2903740	2904860	You don't know if you're going to come up
2904860	2907460	on another vehicle in an instant,
2907460	2908780	which of course can happen.
2908780	2910380	So you have to adjust a number of things.
2910380	2911700	You have to learn how to do that.
2911700	2914940	And while I would never elect to drive in fog,
2914940	2916780	learning to drive in fog teaches you
2916780	2918020	how to be comfortable driving
2918020	2919100	in different weather environments.
2919100	2920540	Same thing with driving in a rainstorm
2920540	2922860	or for you East coasters from the Northeast,
2922860	2924380	learning how to drive in a snowstorm.
2924380	2925820	You would never elect to do that,
2925820	2926980	but once you do it a few times,
2926980	2929940	you feel more comfortable in those extreme conditions.
2929940	2932180	So that's really what raising your stress threshold
2932180	2933060	is all about.
2933060	2935900	Of course, do it safely, do it under conditions
2935900	2937020	in which you're not going to get hurt
2937020	2938780	or anyone else will get hurt.
2938780	2941060	But learning how to do this can be extremely beneficial.
2941060	2944220	And of course, deliberate cold exposure isn't the only way,
2944220	2946220	but frankly, it's the most reliable way
2946220	2948460	and it's the most versatile way to do that
2948460	2949780	because you can do it in your shower
2949780	2951260	or in a cold plunge at home.
2951260	2952860	So you can practice these things.
2952860	2954260	Again, safety first,
2954260	2957260	always make sure you're not exposing yourself to cold
2957260	2958860	to the extent that you're going to damage yourself
2958860	2961740	mentally or physically, but it's a great practice.
2961740	2962940	And you could probably think of other ways
2962940	2965500	to spike your adrenaline that was safe.
2965500	2968140	And of course, life will spike your adrenaline.
2968140	2973140	So you can also use real life as your stress inoculation tool
2973380	2975100	and we all have to do that anyway.
2975100	2978220	What I'm suggesting is that you adopt a real time tool,
2978220	2980340	physiological size, and that you adopt
2980340	2983220	at least one offline tool that you do anywhere from one
2983220	2985140	to three, maybe seven days a week,
2985140	2986820	but at least one day a week that you put yourself
2986820	2989420	into a cold shower, deliberate cold exposure,
2989420	2991860	not for sake of increasing metabolism or anything else,
2991860	2994780	but really just to learn how to calm yourself
2994780	2998140	and maintain clear cognition when stress hits
2998140	3000660	because indeed stress is going to hit.
3000660	3004180	So that's the big six for improving mood and mental health.
3004180	3007460	And the big six apply, that is they are the cornerstone
3007460	3010220	for mood and mental health, regardless of who you are,
3010220	3012700	regardless of your age, regardless of whether or not
3012700	3015220	you're dealing with an acute or a severe mood
3015220	3017540	or mental health disorder, or you find yourself
3017540	3019660	to be reasonably healthy with respect
3019660	3021100	to mood and mental health.
3021100	3022980	And you simply want your mood and mental health
3022980	3026540	to be stable and or improve over time.
3026540	3030060	Now, the reason why the big six, those six pillars
3030060	3032220	are so important for mood and mental health
3032220	3034100	and indeed form a critical component
3035020	3036420	of what Dr. Paul Conti referred to
3036420	3039300	as the first principles of self-care
3039300	3043220	is that those six pillars establish a milieu
3043220	3046260	that is an environment of neurochemicals,
3046260	3049260	including neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin,
3049260	3051980	epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine,
3051980	3055380	and other neurochemicals as well, as well as hormones,
3055380	3058460	testosterone, estrogen, prolactin, cortisol,
3058460	3061820	and immune molecules and on and on
3061820	3065420	that lead to a high degree of predictability
3065420	3067300	in your brain and nervous system.
3067300	3068380	Now, what do I mean by that?
3068380	3071260	Why would predictability be such a key component
3071260	3072580	of mood and mental health?
3072580	3074420	Is it really just about knowing that you're going
3074420	3076380	to feel energized in the early part of the day
3076380	3078020	and tired at the end of the day?
3078020	3079060	Now, that might be part of it,
3079060	3081300	but that's not the major takeaway.
3081300	3084620	The major takeaway is that as Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,
3084620	3087180	so aptly pointed out, your brain
3087180	3089260	and indeed your entire nervous system
3089260	3091180	has a couple of major jobs,
3091180	3093020	has the job of regulating your breathing
3093020	3094980	and your heart rate, et cetera.
3094980	3097260	It also has the job of regulating your thinking
3097260	3098940	and your planning and your memory.
3098940	3101180	Those are the jobs of the brain and nervous system
3101180	3102780	that we normally hear about.
3102780	3104900	But if we think about the more macro jobs
3104900	3108380	that the brain has, the key function of the brain,
3108380	3109940	certainly the parts of the brain
3109940	3112020	that are more recently evolved,
3112020	3114620	the ones involved in thinking and planning, et cetera,
3114620	3117740	are really involved in generating predictions,
3117740	3120300	predictions about what's going to happen next
3120300	3122220	and whether or not you're going to be prepared
3122220	3123740	for what's going to happen next.
3123740	3126060	And indeed, Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett
3126060	3128420	also beautifully illustrated this model
3128420	3132340	of the brain as regulating a brain-body budget
3132340	3136980	and moods and a related topic, which she called affect.
3136980	3139300	Okay, I'll explain what affect is in a moment.
3139300	3143060	Setting the stage for being able to better predict
3143060	3144620	what's going to happen next
3144620	3148660	and therefore regulating your mood in the moment.
3148660	3150620	Let's just take a moment and explore that statement
3150620	3152300	in a little bit more detail.
3152300	3153500	Essentially what she was saying
3153500	3155420	and what I'm now again saying
3155420	3158620	is that your brain and body go through different states.
3158620	3162220	Your state at a given moment can be labeled as your affect.
3162220	3164140	Your affect includes a lot of different things,
3164140	3166580	including levels of autonomic arousal,
3166580	3168580	levels of hormones, levels of trans mirrors,
3168580	3169740	all of that stuff.
3169740	3172660	But it falls under the umbrella of affect.
3172660	3177500	Affect essentially sets the stage for particular emotions
3177500	3180300	to be more likely or less likely to emerge.
3180300	3182860	So emotion and affect aren't the same thing.
3182860	3184620	Affect is a bit more general.
3184620	3187180	It sort of undergirds the possibility
3187180	3189540	of having certain moods like feeling elated,
3189540	3192540	happy or sad or depressed.
3192540	3194380	It really sets the general stage
3194380	3197220	for different types of specific emotions,
3197220	3199380	even highly specific emotions.
3199380	3202980	So in that way, when you're taking care of the big six,
3202980	3206380	when you're tending to these six pillars on a regular basis,
3206380	3208780	and I should point out that we really want to tend
3208780	3211060	to those six pillars every single day
3211060	3213300	or every single 24 hours,
3213300	3215820	we really need to make those a regular investment
3215820	3217940	to the extent that we can.
3217940	3221180	When we do that, we create a neurochemical
3221180	3224500	and a neural milieu that allows the brain
3224500	3227180	to be in a better predictive state.
3227180	3231220	It allows the brain to give rise to certain affects,
3231220	3234380	spelled A-F-F-E-C-T-S,
3234380	3237340	so affects that lead to certain emotions
3237340	3240260	being more or less likely to occur.
3240260	3243020	Put very simply, when we're tending to those six pillars
3243020	3246420	on a regular basis, we feel better more generally,
3246420	3250060	and therefore the emotions that we tend to have
3250060	3251060	under different conditions,
3251060	3253260	even conditions of a difficult interaction
3253260	3255460	with a coworker or with a family member,
3255460	3258420	tend to be more positive than if we are not tending
3258420	3259900	to those six pillars.
3259900	3262580	Now, in some sense, that's sort of a duh statement.
3262580	3264020	For instance, if you're sleep deprived,
3264020	3265740	if you're not fed well,
3265740	3267340	like you haven't eaten in a few hours,
3267340	3269460	of course, you're going to be more irritable,
3269460	3270740	you're going to be more reactive,
3270740	3273460	you are going to be more emotionally labile.
3273460	3274620	But sleep and nutrition
3274620	3277180	are just two of those six core pillars.
3277180	3278900	When we talk about those core pillars
3278900	3280900	and the necessity for tending to them
3280900	3283540	on a regular, every 24-hour basis,
3283540	3284980	what we're really talking about
3284980	3287500	is creating a milieu within our brain and nervous system
3287500	3290500	that allows the nervous system to do what it does best,
3290500	3293500	and in fact, what its main job is to do,
3293500	3295620	which is to predict what's going to happen next.
3295620	3297900	Because as Lisa Feldman Barrett pointed out,
3297900	3301180	emotions are really context-dependent states
3301180	3305220	that allow us to navigate not just our present circumstances,
3305220	3308580	but they are our nervous system and brain's best guess
3308580	3312300	about the circumstances that we are soon going to encounter.
3312300	3313740	Now, I don't offer you all of that
3313740	3317460	as kind of a bunch of a tangled mess of nerd speak
3317460	3318300	to confuse you.
3318300	3321140	What I'm saying is that by tending to those six core pillars,
3321140	3325340	you are shifting the likely affects that you will experience
3325340	3327980	and therefore the likely emotions that you will experience.
3327980	3329540	So you're biasing your whole system
3329540	3333420	towards more positive affect and more positive emotions,
3333420	3336540	regardless of what your life circumstances happen to be
3336540	3338500	and the stressors that you encounter.
3338500	3340300	And indeed, you also are including
3340300	3342700	that six pillar of stress control.
3342700	3344540	So when those stressors arrive,
3344540	3347100	you'll be better able to navigate them.
3347100	3349380	Now, this view of emotion regulation,
3349380	3351020	of mood and mental health,
3351060	3353220	is certainly not a novel concept.
3353220	3355820	People have talked about the physiological regulation of mood
3355820	3358540	from the time of William James and even earlier.
3358540	3360420	It's been a long-standing question, for instance,
3360420	3362700	or debate in psychology and philosophy.
3362700	3366140	Do we feel anxiety in our body and then label it as anxiety,
3366140	3369620	or do we feel anxiety in our mind and then our body follows?
3369620	3370900	That's been a long-standing debate
3370900	3373380	and frankly, there's evidence on both sides,
3373380	3374700	which leads me to the conclusion,
3374700	3376700	I think most neurobiologists and psychologists
3376700	3379220	to the conclusion that those things are interrelated
3379220	3382020	in a way that we can't really dissociate them completely
3382020	3383340	at any level, right?
3383340	3384340	When your heart rate goes up
3384340	3386140	and you start breathing faster,
3386140	3387580	if I were to induce that state in you,
3387580	3390620	you'd probably interpret that as feeling anxious.
3390620	3391460	In addition to that,
3391460	3392980	something can make you anxious
3392980	3394740	before your heart rate and breathing increases
3394740	3396180	and then your heart rate and breathing increases.
3396180	3398340	So no need to tease those apart.
3398340	3400140	But if you think about the brain,
3400140	3402100	in large part as a prediction machine
3402100	3404660	and your brain as a metabolic regulator,
3404660	3407180	it's trying to decide which organs need resources.
3407180	3409820	How much resource can I dedicate to thinking,
3409820	3413300	to creativity, to enjoying social interaction,
3413300	3415260	to paying attention to what somebody else is saying
3415260	3417340	as opposed to what's going on inside my body?
3417340	3419140	All of those major functions of the brain
3419140	3421820	as they relate to affect and emotions
3421820	3423940	are going to be best supported,
3423940	3426900	that is biased toward positive mood,
3426900	3430060	positive affect, positive emotions,
3430060	3433300	and therefore positive mental health outcomes
3433300	3435580	when we're tending to those six pillars.
3435580	3437940	Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett referred to that whole process
3437940	3441180	as the brain regulating a brain body budget.
3441180	3443060	And she had beautiful analogies for that budget.
3443060	3444860	And that's what led to the description
3444860	3447940	of social interactions as either generating savings
3447940	3451300	or being neutral or generating a taxed feeling,
3451300	3453140	literally taxing that brain body budget.
3453140	3454100	And I love that concept.
3454100	3455700	And it's one that you can keep in mind.
3455700	3458620	And indeed we can inject a lot of specificity
3458620	3461780	into this whole process of improving mood and mental health
3461780	3463380	through specific protocols.
3463380	3464820	If you simply remember,
3464820	3469140	if you make a daily investment in the six core pillars,
3469140	3471860	you are building up that brain body budget.
3471860	3475740	You will have more energetic resources to spend
3475740	3478620	on whatever life circumstances come your way.
3478620	3481500	Now, before we move into a discussion about protocols
3481500	3483940	for how to better understand your life narrative
3483940	3486700	to enhance your sense of self and confidence
3486700	3488620	and things of that theme,
3488620	3491300	I briefly want to mention that,
3491300	3493940	of course there are known tools out there
3493940	3496460	in the medical community and psychological community
3496460	3498700	for improving mood and mental health.
3498700	3501980	And while there are a variety of tools,
3501980	3504940	one of the main tools of the psychiatrist
3504940	3506780	is prescription drugs
3506780	3509700	that target specific neuromodulator systems
3509700	3510540	in the brain and body.
3510540	3512580	For instance, SSRI,
3512580	3515100	selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
3515100	3517820	or atypical antidepressants
3517820	3520620	that target the dopamine and epinephrine systems
3520620	3522660	such as wellbutrin, bupryorone
3522660	3524580	or other types of antidepressants.
3524580	3528460	Or for instance, nowadays there's a lot of growing excitement
3528460	3532660	about clinical trials using relatively high dosages
3532660	3535580	of psilocybin, which by the way,
3535580	3538860	closely mimics the chemical serotonin.
3538860	3539940	That's right, psilocybin,
3539940	3543060	which is converted to psilocin in the brain.
3543060	3544260	If you look at it chemically,
3544260	3546180	it looks very much like serotonin
3546180	3548420	although it has distinct effects from serotonin.
3548420	3549620	I talked about psilocybin
3549620	3551860	and what's being done in terms of the clinical trials,
3551860	3553660	safety considerations.
3553660	3555860	I talked about the potential hazard considerations
3555860	3557940	and where the legality and all of that is going
3557940	3560220	in that episode if you want to check that out.
3560220	3562820	But the reason I'm taking a moment to mention these drugs,
3562820	3566060	things like SSRIs, Prozax, Olav, Citalopram,
3566060	3569060	wellbutrin, psilocybin and so on
3569060	3573180	is that all of them target specific neuromodulator systems
3573180	3574580	in the brain and body.
3574580	3577980	And at the same time, it's fairly clear
3578020	3580980	that mood disorders such as major depression
3580980	3583420	are not necessarily deficits
3583420	3585180	in things like serotonin or dopamine.
3585180	3588340	They can be, but most often they are not.
3588340	3592220	So why are such drugs prescribed for mood disorders
3592220	3593380	and for mental health disorders?
3593380	3595860	Well, because if specific neuromodulators
3595860	3598420	like serotonin, dopamine or epinephrine
3598420	3601900	are dramatically increased above baseline,
3601900	3605220	that affords the brain the ability to rewire itself.
3605220	3608060	Really the way to think about SSRIs
3608060	3611300	or atypical antidepressants or psilocybin
3611300	3613060	for the treatment of major depression
3614020	3618300	is really to think about them as chemical tools
3618300	3621260	to open or access neuroplasticity.
3621260	3623060	And that's why it's oh so important
3623060	3625500	that those drugs be combined with talk therapy
3625500	3628020	where people are actively working through the sources,
3628020	3630380	the real life sources and the historical sources,
3630380	3633460	maybe even the trauma-based sources of their depression.
3633460	3636660	And I mention this because there's a lot of debate nowadays
3636660	3639140	as to whether or not these drugs are useful,
3639140	3642140	whether or not the side effect profiles justify their use,
3642140	3646900	whether or not they are applicable to young populations.
3646900	3648180	There's a lot of debate about this.
3648180	3651220	And certainly in the case of the psychedelics,
3651220	3653140	there's a lot, a lot of debate
3653140	3655420	because this is a newly emerging area
3655420	3656860	and there's still not a lot of data,
3656860	3660060	although it's starting to increase over time.
3660060	3663460	But the key point here is that all of these drugs
3663460	3666420	have the potential to work in some people, not others.
3666420	3668500	Some people, they simply don't work for
3668500	3672380	and they cause more problems than solutions they solve,
3672380	3677220	but they tend to work by increasing the propensity
3677220	3681540	for neuroplasticity by changing the neuromodulator milieu
3681540	3682420	in the brain.
3682420	3684740	And this is an important point when thinking about tools
3684740	3686860	for enhancing mood and mental health,
3686860	3688700	that when we think about tools
3688700	3690620	for enhancing mood and mental health.
3691460	3693540	And next, of course, we're going to talk about the tools
3693540	3698140	that are specifically designed to target a specific aspect
3698140	3701100	of one's life story or concept of self.
3701100	3705260	All of that is always operating on a backdrop of two things,
3705260	3708860	that overall neurochemical milieu and autonomic function
3708860	3710860	that the six pillars relate to and support
3710860	3712340	if we're attending to those,
3712340	3714420	but any improvement in mood and mental health
3714420	3717020	that's going to be significant, it's going to be noticeable
3717020	3718300	and it's going to be stable,
3718300	3720260	it's going to be pervasive over time,
3720260	3723380	is going to require that some degree of neuroplasticity,
3723380	3726020	some degree of neural rewiring occur.
3726020	3727180	So I'm not bringing up the topic
3727180	3729380	of these particular drug tools to say that
3729380	3731740	they are the best way to improve mood and mental health.
3731740	3732820	I'm certainly not saying that.
3732820	3735740	They are, but one way to potentially improve
3735740	3736980	mood and mental health.
3736980	3738420	And if they are going to work,
3738420	3741540	they always work best when done in concert
3741540	3742380	with talk therapy,
3742380	3743860	because they are opening the opportunity
3743860	3744820	for neuroplasticity,
3744820	3747540	but then that neuroplasticity has to be directed
3747540	3749540	toward a particular endpoint.
3749540	3751900	There has to be specific work that's being done
3751900	3755180	by the individual or ideally the individual
3755180	3759380	with an expert trained clinically certified therapist
3759380	3763380	or psychologist or psychiatrist in order to make sure
3763380	3765700	that the neuroplastic changes that occur
3765700	3767460	lead to longstanding improvements
3767460	3769060	in mood and mental health over time.
3769060	3771380	Indeed, the drugs that I just described
3771380	3775460	were originally designed as tools to allow people
3775500	3777820	to access changes within their brain
3777820	3780140	that would then allow them to enhance mood
3780140	3782220	and mental health, but not have to rely
3782220	3785620	on the drugs themselves for improved mood and mental health.
3785620	3788620	And along those lines, I'm sure some of you out there
3788620	3790900	are thinking about the supplement-based
3790900	3792300	or nutrition-based approaches
3792300	3794020	to enhancing these neuromodulators.
3794020	3796540	And indeed, while they don't have the same potency
3796540	3798540	as things like Wellbutrin and SSRIs
3798540	3800180	at increasing things like dopamine
3800180	3801860	and serotonin respectively,
3801860	3803260	there is a growing number of people out there
3803260	3805940	that are relying on daily supplementation
3805940	3809260	with anywhere from one to three grams of L-tyrosine,
3809260	3811420	amino acid precursor to dopamine,
3811420	3816180	combined with often 300 to 600 milligrams of alpha-GPC
3816180	3819460	as a way to enhance dopamine and acetylcholine
3819460	3823380	and to set the stage for elevated levels of neuroplasticity.
3823380	3825420	But it's very important to point out
3825420	3827620	that the amino acid precursors
3827620	3829980	to the various neuromodulators like L-tyrosine,
3829980	3834020	like L-tryptophan, so L-tyrosine precursor to dopamine,
3834020	3837660	L-tryptophan precursor to serotonin, and so on,
3837660	3840660	that those don't have the same degree of potency,
3840660	3843180	that is ability to enhance those neuromodulators.
3843180	3846260	And so the extent to which they enrich the possibility
3846260	3849020	for neuroplasticity still remains somewhat obscure.
3849020	3851620	There haven't been clinical trials on that yet,
3851620	3854300	at least not clinical trials that I am aware of.
3854300	3856340	So I mentioned all of that stuff about drugs,
3856340	3857540	whether or not it's psychedelics
3857540	3859380	or whether or not it's prescription antidepressants
3859380	3861340	or whether or not people are using
3861340	3864900	a supplement-based amino acid-based protocol
3864900	3867620	for increasing certain neuromodulators.
3867620	3869420	I feel it was important to mention all of that because,
3869420	3872060	well, first of all, it's quite prominent out there,
3872060	3874260	certainly in the case of prescription antidepressants,
3874260	3876340	and there's growing prominence
3876340	3879620	and use of relatively high dose psilocybin.
3879620	3883380	Again, always done with support talk therapy.
3883380	3886340	This is done in a legal setting.
3886340	3888140	I said legal, not illegal,
3888140	3891060	a legal setting with a board-certified therapist.
3891060	3893340	This is being done on university campuses,
3893340	3894620	within research labs.
3894620	3896300	And of course, I acknowledge that there are people
3896300	3898180	who are using these compounds
3898180	3899700	outside the realm of the university
3899700	3901260	clinical study environment.
3901260	3902500	So I mentioned these chemicals,
3902500	3905500	not because I'm pointing to them as the path
3905500	3907700	to improved mood and mental health.
3907700	3909500	They can be, but they aren't always,
3909500	3910500	and as I mentioned before,
3910500	3912300	they can sometimes cause problems
3912300	3914540	that lead people to wish that they hadn't taken them
3914540	3916740	or to decide to not take them any further,
3916740	3918340	a decision that absolutely has to be made
3918340	3919540	with a healthcare professional
3919540	3921140	who's well certified to do that.
3921140	3922900	But I'm mentioning these tools
3922900	3927900	because I want you to understand if they work, why they work.
3928060	3930220	And one key point that was really emphasized
3930220	3933260	by Dr. Paul Conti, who, as I mentioned before,
3933260	3934140	is a psychiatrist,
3934140	3935980	so he uses pharmacology in his practice,
3935980	3939260	although he uses other non-pharmacologic tools as well,
3939260	3942460	is that these pharmacologic tools are never to be viewed
3942460	3945460	as the be all end all of enhancing mood and mental health.
3945460	3948860	They are but one path to improving mood and mental health
3948860	3951300	and indeed should be viewed as a path
3951300	3954260	to getting people who are otherwise unable to engage
3954260	3955740	in those six core pillars,
3955740	3957420	those first principles of mental health,
3957420	3959980	to be able to do those things on a regular basis.
3959980	3964420	And then perhaps, based on a discussion with their clinician,
3964420	3967220	these people could come off those pharmacologic agents.
3967220	3968300	Maybe yes, maybe no.
3968300	3969540	It depends on the individual.
3969540	3971300	It depends on the circumstances.
3971300	3972860	But those core six pillars,
3972860	3975220	those first principles of mental health
3975220	3979580	that include but are not limited to those core six pillars
3979580	3981660	are absolutely essential.
3981660	3985420	There's no drug that can replace those core six pillars.
3985420	3986540	I'd like to take a quick break
3986540	3988940	and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
3988940	3991420	InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
3991420	3994100	that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
3994100	3995740	to help you better understand your body
3995740	3997500	and help you reach your health goals.
3997500	3998620	I've long been a believer
3998620	4000260	in getting regular blood work done
4000260	4002100	for the simple reason that many of the factors
4002100	4004340	that impact your immediate and long-term health
4004340	4007180	can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
4007180	4010100	A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,
4010100	4012860	is that you get information back about metabolic factors,
4012860	4014540	lipids and hormones and so forth,
4014540	4016580	but you don't know what to do with that information.
4016580	4018780	With InsideTracker, they make it very easy
4018780	4020700	because they have a personalized platform
4020700	4023260	that allows you to see the levels of all those things,
4023260	4025780	metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,
4025780	4028660	but it gives you specific directives that you can follow
4028660	4030980	that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,
4030980	4032260	supplements, et cetera,
4032260	4034540	that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges
4034540	4035900	that are optimal for you.
4035900	4037300	If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
4037300	4040580	you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman
4040580	4043220	to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.
4043220	4046660	Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman.
4046660	4048900	Okay, so setting aside the core six pillars,
4048900	4052140	let's now talk about other tools for mood and mental health
4052140	4056180	that center around really what we more typically think of
4056180	4059980	when we think of mood and mental health, which is emotions.
4059980	4062900	When Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett was a guest on the podcast,
4062900	4065740	she said something that was really incredible,
4065740	4067980	and it's something that's strongly grounded
4067980	4069340	in excellent scientific data,
4069340	4072900	which is the more specificity that we can put
4072900	4075220	to labeling our emotions,
4075220	4076700	the better off we're going to be
4076700	4079780	in terms of our overall mental health.
4079780	4081060	Let me restate that.
4081060	4084380	The more specific language that we can put
4084380	4086860	to our own internal emotions,
4086860	4089060	even if that language is just to ourselves
4089060	4090260	in our own internal narrative,
4090260	4093860	we don't even have to speak out what those labels are,
4093860	4097300	the better that we're going to feel over time.
4097300	4100340	And indeed, this effect can be quite rapid.
4100340	4102740	And indeed, Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett has done research
4102740	4104460	on this very specific topic.
4104460	4107940	It's something that's referred to as emotional granularity.
4107940	4111020	So while some of us move through life
4111020	4115300	with a sort of what I call emojification of emotions,
4115300	4116820	you know, you got your happy face, happy,
4116860	4120540	your sad face, sad, you know, you're angry, depressed,
4120540	4124340	anxious, you know, those are labels for emotional states,
4124340	4126460	or you could think of them as affects or emotions.
4126460	4129100	I think of them as emotions, but they're not very specific.
4129100	4130580	They're pretty broad bins.
4130580	4133900	We say sad or depressed or super depressed
4133900	4136300	or super sad, anxious, panic.
4136300	4137700	And when we think of that as nuance,
4137700	4139660	but it's not very nuanced.
4139660	4142140	And Lisa's laboratory and other laboratories
4142140	4144300	have explored two things.
4144300	4146260	First, if people are asked to or encouraged
4146260	4148940	to put more granularity, more specificity
4148940	4150460	on what they're feeling,
4150460	4153100	then it seems that their levels of emotional processing
4153100	4154420	are better overall.
4154420	4155980	How does that translate to emotions?
4155980	4160980	Well, it translates to better overall feelings of wellbeing
4161540	4166540	when one is placing more specificity on positive emotions.
4166980	4169220	And the flip side is also true.
4169220	4170580	So this is important to know.
4170580	4174180	If one places more specificity on negative emotions,
4174180	4177620	it also can enhance one's kind of experience
4177620	4179460	of those negative emotions.
4179460	4182780	Now, that means that this is a two-sided blade, all right?
4182780	4184380	This isn't always a good thing.
4184380	4186100	And if one is thinking about protocols
4186100	4188100	for improving mood and mental health,
4188100	4192620	the data make very clear that adding more specificity
4192620	4195540	to our positive emotions in terms of the language we use,
4195540	4198060	but also just the depth with which we process
4198060	4200060	and think about those positive experiences
4200060	4202060	can be very beneficial for us.
4202060	4203820	So there are two studies that I'd like to highlight
4203820	4205100	that relate to this.
4205100	4207460	The first is entitled Effective Self-Monitoring
4207460	4208700	Through Experience Sampling
4208700	4212420	on Emotion Differentiation in Depression.
4212420	4214380	And the second study is entitled
4214380	4216060	Emotional Granularity Increases
4216060	4218860	with Intensive Ambulatory Assessment.
4218860	4222420	Methodological and individual factors influence how much.
4222420	4224140	Now, each of these studies focus
4224140	4225140	on something slightly different.
4225140	4226420	The first study was mainly focused
4226420	4228180	on people who have depression,
4228180	4232260	and they were cued several, if not many times per day,
4232260	4236100	to just think about and report on their emotional state.
4236100	4238340	And that was done in order to get people
4238340	4240260	to place more granularity,
4240260	4242020	more specificity on what they're feeling,
4242020	4244460	but also simply to tap into how they're feeling
4244460	4246540	on a more regular basis throughout the day.
4246540	4248540	The second study, which is one that included
4248540	4250980	Dr. Lisa Feldman-Behr as an author,
4250980	4253180	was slightly different because it focused
4253180	4255180	on non-depressed individuals,
4255180	4256940	and it cued them to touch into their emotions
4256940	4258020	more times per day,
4258020	4261420	and it also included some physiological measurements.
4261420	4263500	And one in particular that we're going to talk about
4263500	4264580	in some detail.
4264580	4267180	Now, I don't have time to go into all the details
4267180	4268020	of these studies.
4268020	4269900	I may do that in a future podcast episode,
4269900	4271500	but the key takeaways are very important
4271500	4274220	for all of us to know, which are, first of all,
4275380	4278260	the more often that you can ask yourself,
4278260	4280340	what am I really feeling right now?
4280340	4281980	How do I feel?
4281980	4284100	And, and this is so critical,
4285460	4289620	the more that you force yourself to not use broad labels
4289620	4291980	or simply valence labels.
4291980	4295700	Valence labels are good or okay or bad.
4295700	4300220	And instead, understand that good is not an emotion.
4300220	4301860	Okay is not an emotion.
4301860	4303380	Bad is not an emotion.
4303380	4305860	But rather saying, you know, I feel, you know,
4305860	4307820	curious but a little anxious,
4307820	4308940	if that happens to be the case.
4308940	4311900	Or I feel, you know, bored,
4311900	4315980	but, you know, also a little bit in positive anticipation
4315980	4317420	about what's going to happen tomorrow.
4317420	4318240	Things of that sort,
4318240	4321560	putting more nuance and specificity on your emotions,
4321560	4324200	but also touching into or thinking
4324200	4327160	about your own emotional states more times per day,
4327160	4331240	clearly has positive outcomes for mood and mental health.
4331240	4333440	And the reasons for that are incredibly interesting.
4333440	4335760	And this is something everybody should understand.
4335760	4338240	Why would it be that putting more specificity
4338240	4339280	on what we're feeling?
4339280	4341240	So perhaps just in our own heads,
4341240	4342720	like thinking, okay, how do I feel right now?
4342720	4344720	Like if I were to do that right now,
4344720	4347320	I'd say I feel energized
4347320	4349320	and happy.
4349320	4351120	I do, I really enjoy doing what I'm doing.
4351120	4355200	So I wouldn't say I'm like off the charts in awe
4355200	4358480	or elation, but I'm very happy and I feel energized.
4358480	4359320	You know, earlier today,
4359320	4361940	I was feeling a little bit fatigued
4361940	4363880	and a little bit confused
4363880	4365320	because I was trying to sort out something
4365320	4367920	and it wasn't making sense to me.
4367920	4370160	So assessments like that,
4370160	4372140	which can be told to somebody else
4372140	4374140	or that we just hold internally,
4374140	4375640	done repeatedly throughout the day,
4375640	4378000	anywhere from three to six times throughout the day,
4378000	4379840	just periodically pinging ourselves.
4379840	4380900	Maybe you set an alarm
4380900	4383760	or maybe you just decide to every once in a while,
4383760	4385840	maybe every time you go into an elevator
4385840	4387160	or every time you go up a flight of stairs,
4387160	4389640	you just ask yourself, yeah, how do I feel right now?
4389640	4391480	And thinking about that for a moment.
4391480	4392840	And you don't have to write it down,
4392840	4394320	although I suppose you could.
4394320	4396840	What turns out that just that practice
4396840	4399840	can really enhance our so-called emotional granularity
4399840	4403680	that can enhance our positive emotions and affect.
4403680	4406760	And in addition, it provides us a better sensitivity
4406760	4410640	to better understand those negative emotions,
4410640	4412660	which sounds like it might be a bad thing,
4412660	4415560	but those negative emotions have information in them.
4415560	4417200	Right, this is one thing that's often lost
4417200	4420280	in those broad categorizations of anxious
4420280	4421800	or sad or depressed.
4421800	4422640	And keep in mind, of course,
4422640	4424640	that some people are genuinely clinically depressed
4424640	4426360	and that needs to be taken extremely seriously,
4426360	4429280	just like some people are genuinely clinically anxious
4429280	4431280	and that needs to be taken seriously.
4431280	4434560	But most of us, when we throw out the words depressed,
4434560	4437360	angry, sad, we're not using enough nuance
4437360	4439960	and it doesn't really apply to our internal states
4439960	4441480	or the circumstances that we're in.
4441480	4443960	And as a consequence, we suffer.
4443960	4445920	It's not just about communicating our emotions,
4445920	4449800	we suffer because the data say that the more nuance,
4449800	4452640	the more emotional granularity that we have,
4452640	4456320	the richer is our experience of the positive aspects of life
4456320	4460580	and the more effectively we can navigate
4460580	4463320	the negative aspects of life, right?
4463320	4466100	Again, negative emotions perhaps isn't the best way
4466100	4468440	to even describe negative emotions
4468440	4470980	because that label negative implies that we should avoid it.
4470980	4472540	And in fact, those negative emotions
4472540	4475580	provide a lot of information about perhaps
4475580	4477620	social interactions that we should seek to avoid
4477620	4479980	in the future and so on and so forth.
4479980	4482500	Now, one of the most interesting things
4482500	4485820	about this whole process of increasing emotional granularity
4485820	4487340	and touching in several times per day
4487340	4490420	into how we feel, something that's completely zero cost,
4490420	4492060	takes just a moment to do,
4492060	4493740	that we can get much better at over time.
4493740	4495320	That was clearly seen in these studies
4495320	4496980	that people get much better at doing this.
4496980	4500060	It becomes more facile for them very quickly
4500060	4502860	is that it correlates with improvements
4502860	4505700	in physiological metrics that relate
4505700	4508660	to overall improvements in mood and mental health.
4508660	4512180	And the specific physiological metric that I'm referring to
4512180	4514420	is so-called vagal tone.
4514420	4517380	Some of you have perhaps heard of the vagus nerve.
4517380	4518640	It's the 10th cranial nerve.
4518640	4520600	It's an extensive peripheral nerve
4520600	4525320	that it goes out of the brain at the level of the neck.
4525320	4527720	It's one of the cranial nerves that extends
4527720	4529800	to essentially all the organs of the body,
4529800	4532200	the heart, the lungs, et cetera, but it's a two-way street.
4532200	4534100	It's a superhighway of nerves out of the brain
4534100	4537360	and into the body, and it's a superhighway of nerves
4537360	4540560	back from the bodily organs to the brain.
4540560	4543520	And it's involved in regulating a lot of
4543520	4544920	so-called autonomic functions.
4544920	4546680	So how fast our heart rate is,
4546680	4549280	how fast our breathing is, rates of digestion.
4549280	4552240	And all of that weaves together to create those things
4552240	4555400	that we call affect our internal states.
4555400	4558720	So without going into a ton of detail about the vagus nerve,
4558720	4562160	there's something that's called cardiac vagal control.
4562160	4564660	Cardiac vagal control is the extent to which
4564660	4567880	that vagus nerve can impact your heart rate
4567880	4572000	and your overall feelings of calm or alertness.
4572000	4574440	Now, the simple way to think about this
4574440	4577840	is more commonly referred to as heart rate variability.
4577840	4579920	Heart rate variability is simply the distance
4579920	4580900	between your heartbeats,
4580900	4583340	or rather the time between your heartbeats,
4583340	4586880	which we know if those timings between your heartbeats
4586880	4588600	are somewhat variable,
4588600	4591940	that is correlated with positive physical
4591940	4593880	and mental health outcomes.
4593880	4596020	One of the ways that you can increase heart rate variability
4596020	4599200	is to get regular cardiovascular exercise,
4599200	4601120	as well as doing resistance exercise,
4601120	4604320	and no surprise, getting sufficient amounts
4604320	4606480	of quality sleep each night is also going to be
4606480	4609380	very beneficial for heart rate variability.
4609380	4611900	Now, exercise and sleep, of course, are wonderful,
4611900	4615100	but it turns out that there's also a very rapid way
4615100	4617080	to increase heart rate variability
4617080	4620840	by activating the vagal innervation of the heart
4620840	4623940	and the way that the heart and some other circuits
4623940	4626080	within the so-called brainstem interact.
4626080	4630280	And that's through something called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
4630280	4634200	Respiratory sinus arrhythmia can be summarized very simply
4634200	4639000	by saying when you inhale, you speed your heart rate up,
4639000	4643080	and when you exhale, you slow your heart rate down.
4643080	4645920	And it's that exhale, slowing your heart rate down
4645920	4648280	that's mediated by the vagus nerve.
4648280	4650680	Now, there's a more thorough description of that,
4650680	4653200	which I'll just give you now, and it's not that lengthy.
4653200	4654860	So here's how it goes.
4654860	4659840	When you inhale, your diaphragm actually moves down,
4659840	4663580	and as a consequence, your heart actually gets a little bigger,
4663580	4665120	has a little more space.
4665120	4666880	As a consequence, the fluid in your heart
4666880	4669600	moves a little more slowly per unit volume,
4669600	4673040	and there's a neural signal to speed the heart up.
4673040	4676020	Conversely, when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.
4676020	4678280	That means there's a little less space for the heart
4678280	4680000	in the general area where it's sitting,
4680000	4681120	so the heart gets a little bit smaller,
4681120	4682080	a little more compact.
4682080	4683720	That means that the fluid in your heart
4683720	4686760	is moving more quickly through that smaller space,
4686760	4689160	and there's a neural signal mediated by the vagus
4689160	4690920	to slow the heart down.
4690920	4692940	So that's why inhale, speed your heart up,
4692940	4695460	and exhales, slow your heart down.
4695460	4698200	That is the basis of so-called RSA,
4698200	4700840	or respiratory sinus arrhythmia.
4700840	4703420	Now, what does any of that have to do
4703420	4705400	with the granularity of language
4705400	4708040	that we place on our emotions?
4708040	4710320	Turns out there's several studies showing
4710320	4715080	that when people place more descriptive granularity
4715080	4717700	on their emotions, that is correlated with, okay?
4717700	4721020	It's not causal, but it's correlated with improvements
4721020	4723060	in respiratory sinus arrhythmia,
4723060	4724980	which we know correlate with improvements
4724980	4726460	in heart rate variability.
4726460	4728620	Indeed, it's one of the major bases
4728620	4730020	for heart rate variability,
4730020	4731620	which we know is correlated
4731620	4734780	with not just positive physical health outcomes,
4734780	4736820	but positive mental health outcomes,
4736820	4739540	including lower levels of anxiety, improved sleep,
4739540	4741240	and overall levels of mood.
4741240	4743520	This is a topic that I'm very familiar with,
4743520	4745620	because last year, my laboratory
4745620	4747260	at Stanford University School of Medicine
4747260	4749200	in collaboration with a colleague of mine,
4749200	4752620	Dr. David Spiegel, our Associate Chair of Psychiatry,
4752620	4755020	also at Stanford University School of Medicine,
4755020	4758080	published a clinical trial in Cell Reports Medicine,
4758080	4761420	showing that there's a particular pattern of breathing
4761420	4765120	that people can do for just five minutes per day
4765120	4768540	that is effective in significantly improving
4768540	4773540	various metrics related to mood, and reducing anxiety,
4773920	4775940	and also improving sleep.
4775940	4778740	Although I should say the protocol I'm about to describe
4778740	4782460	didn't uniformly improve all of those metrics.
4782460	4784540	It had a bigger effect on some versus others.
4784540	4787260	I'll provide a link to that study in the show note captions.
4787260	4789620	But if you're wondering what this protocol is
4789620	4791240	that people did for five minutes a day
4791240	4792820	that allowed them to, by the way,
4792820	4794580	pervasively improve their mood.
4794580	4795740	So it wasn't just their mood
4795740	4798300	while they were doing this five minute a day protocol.
4798300	4802260	It was improvements in mood around the clock, essentially,
4802260	4804640	as well as improvements in other physiological metrics
4804640	4807640	and other aspects of those six core pillars.
4807640	4811560	It was that physiological sigh that we talked about earlier.
4811560	4812520	Although in this case,
4812520	4815160	we didn't have people do just one physiological sigh.
4815160	4817740	We had people set aside five minutes per day.
4817740	4819320	So set a timer for five minutes.
4819320	4820800	They could sit or lie down.
4821800	4823860	They could do it any time of day.
4823860	4827100	And we just had them repeat that physiological sigh
4827100	4829360	for a duration of five minutes total
4829360	4832440	so that they would do two inhales through the nose,
4832440	4835200	and then a full exhale to lungs empty through the mouth.
4835200	4836840	Then they would do it again,
4836840	4837860	and then they would do it again.
4837860	4840320	And again, until those five minutes were completed.
4840320	4842660	Again, the outcome of that clinical trial
4842660	4845520	was that that particular pattern of breathing,
4845520	4847920	which we called cyclic physiological sighing
4847920	4849680	for five minutes per day,
4849680	4851880	again, done any time of day,
4851880	4854240	had the most positive outcomes
4854240	4856520	in terms of improving mood and mental health
4856520	4857660	and autonomic function,
4857660	4860560	those things related to sleep and heart rate variability.
4860560	4864140	So that's a very simple, very minimal time investment,
4864140	4866820	zero cost tool that anyone can use
4866820	4870200	that again improves various metrics of physical health,
4870200	4872640	but also improves metrics of mental health.
4872640	4876320	And it ties right back in with what was observed
4876320	4879480	in the work by Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,
4879480	4884260	exploring how putting more word label,
4884260	4887400	emotional granularity on one's emotional states
4887400	4889680	positively impact our physiological state.
4889680	4891400	And the fact that thinking about our emotions
4891400	4893240	more frequently throughout the day
4893240	4897120	and deliberately putting more label granularity
4897120	4900720	on those emotions frequently throughout the day
4900720	4902800	is correlated with this improvement
4902800	4906480	in respiratory sinus arrhythmia and heart rate variability.
4906480	4908400	The fact that these things all relate to one another
4908400	4910520	should not surprise us because indeed
4910520	4912080	there's a previous paper,
4912080	4914040	this is a quite extensive review.
4914040	4915980	Actually, it's a very nice review.
4915980	4917800	It's one that I encourage anyone who's interested
4917800	4919320	in these topics to explore,
4919320	4921920	especially psychologists who might have a interest
4921920	4923720	in physiology or psychiatrists
4923720	4927040	or simply people who are interested in mind-body stuff.
4927040	4929200	This is a review published in 2017
4929200	4931080	in the journal, Biological Psychology,
4931080	4933180	entitled Cardiac Vagal Control
4933180	4935920	as a Marker of Emotion Regulation in Healthy Adults,
4935920	4936760	a review.
4936760	4939900	And again, it's a really wonderful literature review
4939900	4942280	of the peer-reviewed primary research,
4942280	4946500	which really establishes that this thing, vagal tone,
4946500	4949120	our ability to kind of put the brakes
4949120	4950380	on our autonomic nervous system
4950380	4952380	and slow our heart rate down deliberately
4952380	4953380	through our breathing,
4953380	4956100	and perhaps even just by stopping and reflecting
4956100	4958300	on what our emotional states are
4958300	4960860	is really beneficial for our overall mood
4960860	4961700	and mental health.
4961700	4963340	And I want to highlight, bold,
4963340	4965980	and underline that word overall,
4965980	4967140	because it's not just the case
4967140	4969560	that people experience elevated mood and mental health
4969560	4970940	in the moments where they stop and go,
4970940	4972140	oh, how am I feeling?
4972140	4975980	Oh, you know, am I feeling bored or agitated?
4975980	4978180	Do I feel particularly excited?
4978180	4982180	Sure, that can have some impact on physiological metrics
4982180	4983300	and mood and mental health,
4983300	4985260	but in all of these studies,
4985260	4988260	the outcome seems to be that people's overall levels
4988260	4989960	of mood and mental health are enhanced,
4989960	4992100	not just while they're thinking about their emotions
4992100	4994700	or doing this five-minute-a-day cyclic sighing,
4994700	4997020	but around the clock, which is really terrific
4997020	4998920	because I think that's what most all of us want,
4998920	5000880	which is improved mood and mental health,
5000880	5003380	not just in the moments when we do a practice
5003380	5004740	or in the few minutes afterwards,
5004740	5007100	but 24 hours a day.
5007100	5009140	I suppose we might segment out sleep
5009140	5011100	during which, you know, hopefully we're having great dreams
5011100	5013120	as opposed to other kinds of dreams.
5013120	5017260	But the point is everyone, I have to imagine,
5017260	5018620	would like to feel better
5018620	5020700	and have elevated mood and mental health
5020700	5022140	during the times when they're awake.
5022140	5024460	And indeed, these sorts of protocols
5024460	5025760	have been shown to do that,
5025760	5027860	or so say the scientific data.
5027860	5029540	Now we are going to discuss the tools
5029540	5031660	for enhancing mood and mental health
5031660	5033640	gleaned from the four-episode guest series
5033640	5035180	with Dr. Paul Conti,
5035180	5038440	who is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry.
5038440	5041240	He also has particular expertise in trauma.
5041240	5042860	However, the four-episode guest series
5042860	5044360	that we did with Dr. Conti
5044360	5046840	was really about exploring the self,
5046840	5049160	as well as tools and protocols
5049160	5052120	for not just gaining a better understanding of oneself,
5052120	5054000	but also for gaining a better understanding
5054000	5058160	and tools for relating to others, AKA relationships.
5058160	5060440	Thread through the series was a model of the mind
5060440	5062700	and how it works to create everything
5062700	5065660	from feelings, thoughts, to behaviors
5065660	5068900	that Dr. Paul Conti described as an iceberg model.
5068900	5071000	And I perhaps should refer you to the fact
5071000	5073220	that he actually drew out this model
5073220	5075760	and we provided it as a zero-cost PDF
5075760	5076880	in the show note captions
5076880	5078900	for every single one of those episodes
5078900	5080740	in that four-episode series.
5080740	5082980	We also provide a link to this model
5082980	5086060	in the show note captions for this tools episode.
5086060	5087860	The model is called the iceberg model.
5087860	5090620	And as the name suggests, it resembles an iceberg
5090620	5094380	in which the vast majority of our mind's processing
5094380	5098080	occurs below our conscious awareness in our unconscious mind.
5098080	5099420	So that's the portion of the iceberg
5099420	5101360	that resides below the surface.
5101360	5103180	Whereas the portion of our mental processing
5103180	5106800	that we are aware of resides above the water surface,
5106800	5108260	the so-called conscious mind.
5108260	5110140	So a key aspect of the iceberg model
5110140	5112840	is that the unconscious mind is responsible
5112840	5115540	for the vast majority of our feelings,
5115540	5116960	thoughts, and behaviors,
5116960	5118280	but that we are not aware
5118280	5120760	of how this unconscious mind is doing that.
5120760	5123160	And by extension, the tools and protocols
5123160	5124760	that Dr. Conti described,
5124760	5127880	largely deal with going into the unconscious
5127880	5130200	and figuring out how the unconscious processing
5130200	5132540	is influencing our conscious processing,
5132540	5134960	both in healthy and in unhealthy ways.
5134960	5137620	And when we say in healthy and unhealthy ways,
5137620	5140880	we're largely referring to the presence of defenses.
5140880	5143120	So some of you have perhaps heard of defenses before.
5143120	5145280	Some defenses can indeed be healthy
5145280	5146960	and others are unhealthy.
5146960	5151840	There are defenses such as projection, sublimation, denial.
5151840	5153680	And during the course of that four episode series,
5153680	5155800	Dr. Conti explains how projections
5155800	5157040	are not always bad for us.
5157040	5161680	Indeed, they can protect us from panic, from severe trauma,
5161680	5164180	but they also can create difficulties
5164180	5166760	in processing our own understanding of self
5166760	5168040	and of our life experiences
5168040	5170680	in ways that can actually be damaging to us.
5170680	5173380	So a key takeaway from that four episode series
5173380	5175520	is to understand and acknowledge
5175520	5177600	that your unconscious mind is driving
5177600	5180080	much of what you feel, think and do.
5180080	5183480	However, by doing structured exploration of the self,
5183480	5185320	and we'll talk about how to do that,
5185320	5187000	one can gain better understanding
5187000	5188840	of how that unconscious processing
5188840	5192960	is influencing what you think, feel, believe and do.
5192960	5196080	So once you accept the important role of the unconscious mind
5196080	5197640	and you make the decision that you want
5197640	5199840	to better understand how your unconscious mind
5199840	5202200	and conscious mind are in this constant dialogue
5202200	5205120	and how you can have that dialogue better serve you,
5205120	5208120	there are a series of actionable tools that you can do
5208120	5211080	that will allow you to better understand yourself
5211080	5212640	and how you relate to others.
5212640	5214040	And the first of these tools
5214040	5217080	is to really understand your self concept.
5217080	5220200	Now, of course, most all of us know our own name.
5220200	5222120	Rarely do we ever forget that name.
5222120	5223920	We have some concept of where we're from,
5223920	5227660	who our parents are, what our present and future goals
5227660	5229180	might be, where we've succeeded,
5229180	5231620	where we failed in life and on and on.
5231620	5233480	But the self concept goes far beyond
5233480	5237680	that sort of CV list or our biography of self.
5237680	5239920	Indeed, the self concept has a lot to do
5239920	5243880	with our self confidence, our feelings of ability,
5243880	5246040	both to overcome challenges,
5246040	5249000	but also our ability to serve the world that we're in
5249000	5251600	and our ability to change ourselves over time.
5251600	5253600	Now, of course, the degree to which somebody
5253600	5256080	might have confidence or less confidence
5256080	5257480	or the degree to which somebody feels
5257480	5259880	that they can exert influence on their environment
5259880	5262320	and their goals is of course going to vary
5262320	5264300	based on their personal history.
5264300	5268160	But as Dr. Conti explained, even independent of all that,
5268160	5271040	if one puts in some work to better understand
5271040	5273920	their self concept, to really get a clear picture
5273920	5277800	of one's self, from that one can develop more agency
5277800	5280440	with which to pursue one's aspirations
5280440	5282000	and to reach their goals.
5282000	5285840	And the key concept here is one that's particularly powerful
5285840	5289660	for both exploring and building up one's concept of self.
5289660	5291960	And that's to consciously and deliberately build
5291960	5293160	a life narrative.
5293160	5295940	Now, a simple way to do this that can be very effective
5295940	5299500	is to create a series of folders or documents.
5299500	5301240	It could even be a stack of papers.
5301240	5303560	I prefer to do this in electronic form.
5303560	5306000	And I confess that even before learning about this tool
5306000	5309160	from Dr. Conti, I had initiated doing this tool
5309160	5311400	starting back in 2015.
5311400	5314240	And it's fairly straightforward, but as I mentioned before,
5314240	5315640	it can be very powerful.
5315640	5319280	And it simply consists of building out separate folders
5319280	5321840	or pieces of paper, and this could be done electronically
5321840	5324400	or on real world paper with paper and pen
5324400	5325480	or paper and pencil.
5325480	5328120	And essentially what you do is you're going to divide
5328120	5331800	your life history into some regular increments.
5331800	5334320	So for me, the way that I did this is I created a folder
5334320	5337760	on my laptop that I actually call Lifetime.
5337760	5339100	So that's the title of the main folder.
5339100	5341480	And then within that folder, I have a series of folders,
5341480	5344720	each of which spans a particular phase of my life.
5344720	5348080	So zero to five years of age, six to 10 years of age,
5348080	5351200	11 to 15 years of age, and so on and so forth.
5351200	5354240	Now I'm 48 years old, so I have folders that extend
5354240	5357560	to age 50 currently, although I will add folders
5357560	5359080	going forward very soon.
5359080	5361760	And the idea here is that for each of those folders,
5361760	5364080	you're going to place a single word document
5364080	5365200	into that folder.
5365200	5368760	And then on that word document, you're not going to journal,
5368760	5371480	you're not going to do any sort of extensive writing,
5371480	5375600	rather you're simply going to put down bullet points
5375600	5377740	with titles, it could be one or two sentences,
5377740	5380080	but typically it's just a few words describing
5380080	5382940	some of the key milestone events that you remember
5382940	5385040	from that particular phase of your life.
5385040	5386920	So just for sake of example, I'll read off some
5386920	5389200	of the things that are included in the folders
5389200	5391780	for my particular lifetime narrative.
5391780	5394160	But of course, this relates to my lifetime narrative,
5394160	5396160	you should of course, put the milestones
5396160	5398920	and key bullet points that relate to your lifetime narrative.
5398920	5400800	But again, just to give you a sense of the sorts of things
5400800	5402720	that made it into this folder,
5402720	5407080	in my six years old to 11 year old folder,
5407080	5409900	on that document, I put where I was living at that time,
5409900	5412140	the city I was living, the school that I went to,
5412140	5414660	I put a couple of teachers names,
5414660	5417220	teachers that had a particular influence on me,
5417220	5419580	a particular summer camp experience,
5419580	5421620	that was not a traumatic experience by the way,
5421620	5423600	it was a happy experience, but for me,
5423600	5425960	it turned out to be a very transformative one.
5425960	5427980	And then there were a couple other things in there
5427980	5431500	that are just recollections of childhood friends names.
5431500	5434180	So seemingly mundane information perhaps,
5434180	5436520	but it looks more or less like a biography
5436520	5438140	and yet other folders.
5438140	5442180	So for instance, the folder that spans from 25
5442180	5444940	to 30 years of age is the time that I was
5444940	5447140	in graduate school, so it includes a note
5447140	5449340	about graduate school, a note about particular hobbies
5449340	5450620	that I was interested in,
5450620	5452820	in addition to my scientific research at the time,
5452820	5454300	a couple of key relationships,
5454300	5456540	a couple of key relationship challenges,
5456540	5458580	as well as some things that at that time,
5458580	5460700	I was processing about prior years,
5460700	5463340	in particular my teen years in high school.
5463340	5465220	Now, the key thing here is that whatever goes
5465220	5467660	into these folders is what's important to you.
5467660	5470500	It could be positive events, it could be negative events.
5470500	5473440	It could be events that for whatever reason you remember
5473440	5475560	and that keep surfacing in your mind
5475560	5477620	that you think might be interesting or important
5477620	5479580	at some later time or that you're concerned
5479580	5480420	you might forget.
5480420	5482100	In fact, that might be a really good metric
5482100	5483740	for whether or not you include something
5483740	5484940	in these folders or not.
5484940	5486520	If there's something that you want to make sure
5486520	5489900	that you never forget, but that you think you might forget,
5489900	5492020	I would encourage you to put it onto that word document
5492020	5494020	and put it into that particular folder.
5494020	5497780	Again, this isn't about creating a coherent life story.
5497780	5500460	This is about creating a series of segments
5500460	5503500	of small collections of key life events,
5503500	5506260	positive, negative, neutral, inspiring,
5506260	5508420	basically anything that was salient for you
5508420	5509980	at that particular time.
5509980	5512540	And of course, if you want to put reflections
5512540	5515020	about those particular events into that word document,
5515020	5516380	you're more than welcome to do that.
5516380	5521020	But the basis of this self-concept developing exercise
5521020	5524340	is just that, it's to develop a historical sense
5524340	5525340	of yourself.
5525340	5527380	Of course, bringing you up to present day
5527380	5529420	where you will continue to add things
5529420	5532100	to whatever word document goes into that particular folder
5532100	5533900	for the age you happen to be now.
5533900	5534740	Now, for some of you,
5534740	5537580	this kind of autobiographical bullet pointing
5537580	5539020	might seem like it's just that,
5539020	5541900	some attempt to build or write an autobiography.
5541900	5544100	But it's very important to remember
5544100	5546040	that these folders are for you.
5546040	5548260	These folders are not about writing a book
5548260	5549220	about your life history.
5549220	5551660	Although if you decide to do that with these folders
5551660	5554580	at some point down the line, that sounds great,
5554580	5556540	but that's not the goal here.
5556540	5559100	The goal is for you to build a structured,
5559100	5561540	narrative representation of events
5561540	5563500	that were key in your life.
5563500	5565660	And as described in the series with Dr. Conti,
5565660	5569100	this goes way beyond just understanding your past.
5569100	5571180	This is really about understanding past.
5571180	5573260	It's about understanding yourself at present.
5573260	5575620	And indeed it threads into your goals
5575620	5577580	and aspirations for the future.
5577580	5579500	An important thing to understand about this tool
5579500	5584060	or protocol is that it also has a incredible ability
5584060	5588380	to anchor you in your perception of the passage of time.
5588380	5590980	Some of us track the passage of time better than others,
5590980	5594220	both within the day and across days and years and so forth.
5594220	5597020	But this exercise in particular is very good
5597020	5600380	at allowing you to see how much time you devoted
5600380	5602540	at a given stage of your life to a given endeavor,
5602540	5604500	whether or not you're stuck in patterns
5604500	5606220	whereby you're still engaging
5606220	5607820	in certain types of things professionally
5607820	5609780	or relationship wise,
5609780	5612540	or in any other number of different ways
5612540	5615100	that have you in a pattern
5615100	5617500	that may or may not be serving you well.
5617500	5619700	I want to emphasize again that this exercise
5619700	5621540	is not about goal setting.
5621540	5623660	It's about your ability to build
5623660	5625620	a structured narrative pattern
5625620	5628100	from which you can look at it
5628100	5630820	and then make a determination as to whether or not,
5630820	5633820	you feel that you're currently on the right path for you.
5633820	5636180	But it's not about projecting forward
5636180	5637580	as to what your goals are.
5637580	5638740	We'll soon talk about that.
5638740	5641060	We'll talk about goals and aspirations in a moment.
5641060	5643300	This is really about better understanding
5643300	5645980	what led you up to the place that you are now.
5645980	5648060	And it really helps you pinpoint the key work
5648060	5650860	that you need to do in terms of exploring your unconscious
5650860	5652940	and conscious mind using some tools
5652940	5654580	that we're going to get into subsequently.
5654580	5656020	So there's really no strict rules
5656020	5658020	about how to do this exactly,
5658020	5660260	except that I do encourage you to make those increments
5660260	5662300	across your lifespan manageable.
5662300	5664740	I wouldn't suggest doing it one for every year.
5664740	5667660	I wouldn't suggest a folder, one for every 10 years.
5667660	5669980	I think a three to five year increment
5669980	5671340	seemed like a more reasonable
5671340	5673060	and tractable way to go about this.
5673060	5674700	So that's one of the sorts of tools
5674700	5676660	that Dr. Conti referred to
5676660	5679460	as to how to build up one's self-concept,
5679460	5682140	which directly relates to things such as our confidence,
5682140	5684820	our ability to track our own behavior,
5684820	5686540	understand some of our motivations,
5686540	5688020	both conscious and unconscious.
5688020	5691460	But of course, that practice is mainly a conscious exercise.
5691460	5694460	It's really not tapping directly into the unconscious
5694460	5697060	in any kind of direct way as far as we know.
5697060	5699340	Now we can contrast that with the tools and protocols
5699340	5701820	that are designed to tap into the unconscious mind.
5701820	5703660	And of course, there are a number of different ways
5703660	5705260	to do this that were discussed
5705260	5707620	in that four episode series with Dr. Conti.
5707620	5709820	But one of the most powerful ways to do this
5709820	5713540	is by thinking about and indeed sometimes writing about
5713540	5716020	or even analyzing one's dreams.
5716020	5717660	Now dream analysis is something
5717660	5719580	for which you can find a lot of books out there.
5719580	5720580	There are a lot of theories.
5720580	5723020	There's also a lot of argument that perhaps dream analysis,
5723020	5724820	which has roots in Freudian psychology,
5724820	5728980	as well as other traditions is perhaps not accurate.
5728980	5730300	I don't think we want to consider
5730300	5732580	whether or not dream analysis is accurate.
5732580	5735020	Rather, I think we should just acknowledge
5735020	5736540	that when we are dreaming,
5736540	5738260	in particular the dreams that we have
5738260	5740220	toward the later part of our night,
5740220	5741340	which are the dreams associated
5741340	5742940	with rapid eye movement sleep
5742940	5745580	that tend to be very emotionally late in dreams
5745580	5748620	as compared to the dreams that we have earlier in the night.
5748620	5751260	Well, when we consider the content of those dreams,
5751260	5753140	even if we're not trying to interpret them,
5753140	5755540	it's very clear that those dreams reflect
5755540	5758100	the unconscious mind controlling more
5758100	5760380	of our internal dialogue
5760380	5762660	or what we are experiencing at that time.
5762660	5763660	Whereas when we are awake,
5763660	5766660	our conscious mind tends to take over more of the narrative,
5766660	5768660	the internal narrative and the control
5768660	5770260	of our feelings, thoughts and behaviors.
5770260	5771260	But as I mentioned before,
5771260	5774100	the unconscious mind is always exerting an influence
5774100	5776700	regardless of whether or not we are asleep or awake.
5776740	5779500	With that said, one way to explore the unconscious mind
5779500	5781620	and to begin to get a better understanding
5781620	5783060	about how it might be influencing
5783060	5785540	our waking states and behaviors
5785540	5789660	is to actually record and think about one's dreams.
5789660	5791900	Now, of course, some people remember their dreams
5791900	5794340	on a regular basis, other people don't.
5794340	5797340	Some people actually believe that they don't dream.
5797340	5799580	Studies out of sleep laboratories at Stanford,
5799580	5801580	University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and elsewhere
5801580	5804100	all generally agree that everybody dreams,
5804100	5806580	but not everybody remembers their dreams.
5806580	5810100	So if you're interested in tapping into an understanding
5810100	5812940	of what your dreams are telling you,
5812940	5815140	which is basically a way of saying
5815140	5819700	what your unconscious mind or dialogue consists of,
5819700	5822100	I highly recommend putting a journal.
5822100	5824580	So this would be any kind of paper and pen
5824580	5825900	or paper and pencil type journal.
5825900	5829140	And the idea is this, if you wake up
5829140	5832060	and you can remember your dream,
5832060	5834860	write down a few key bullet points from that dream.
5834860	5836700	If you feel you can write out the dream
5836700	5839060	in a very linear narrative, this happened,
5839060	5840140	then that happened, then this happened,
5840140	5840980	then that happened, great.
5840980	5843980	But most people find that their memory of their dream
5843980	5846020	is rather fragmentary.
5846020	5848940	Other people can't remember their dream,
5848940	5850580	or at least they wake up,
5850580	5852300	they feel like they were having a dream,
5852300	5855460	but they can't remember all of it or key components of it.
5855460	5858500	And for that, I suggest that you try keeping your body
5858500	5861780	completely still and closing your eyes once again.
5861780	5863700	We don't quite understand why this is,
5863700	5867380	but when you look at the literature on dream recollection,
5867380	5871020	it seems that by keeping one's body completely still
5871020	5873980	with eyes closed, we have better access
5873980	5876420	to whatever the contents of the dream
5876420	5878140	that just occurred were, okay?
5878140	5880260	So if you wake up and you can't remember your dreams,
5880260	5882740	try lying still for a few minutes
5882740	5885660	and keeping your eyes closed and seeing whether or not
5885660	5888060	that helps surface the content of that dream.
5888060	5890220	Other people find that they get up, they get out of bed,
5890220	5892460	and then sometime in the middle of the morning,
5892460	5893900	maybe even later in the day,
5893900	5895780	the contents of a dream will just come to them.
5895780	5896980	Well, if that happens, great.
5896980	5899900	I also highly recommend that you have a way to write down
5899900	5901900	the contents of that dream.
5901900	5903140	Now, what you're looking for
5903140	5905300	when you do this sort of tool or protocol,
5905300	5908620	I encourage you to be wary of any immediate interpretation
5908620	5911380	of, for instance, okay, animals in a dream mean children,
5911380	5912980	although they could.
5912980	5915420	There's not a lot of science that really supports that
5915420	5916700	as a firm statement.
5916700	5918900	And of course, there are books out there and podcasts
5918900	5920420	and a ton of information
5920420	5922060	trying to help you interpret your dreams.
5922060	5923460	And while some of that can be fun
5923460	5925580	and not all of it is entirely useless,
5925580	5927700	the goal here is not to interpret your dreams.
5927700	5929680	The goal here is to start recording
5929680	5931060	some of the key takeaways,
5931060	5933380	maybe even the entire narrative of the dreams
5933380	5935620	that you have just prior to waking
5935620	5937820	as a way to try and understand some of the themes
5937820	5942060	that are occurring and recurring in the dialogue
5942060	5944100	that exists within your unconscious mind.
5944100	5946220	So a key aspect of this tool is that
5946220	5948420	you're not going to take any one dream
5948420	5951140	as an enormously informative dream.
5951140	5954900	It might be, but more important in this particular tool
5954900	5957260	is to write down the themes of a particular dream
5957260	5959620	and then see whether or not those particular themes
5959620	5963580	resurface again and again across different nights
5963580	5965240	or across different dreams.
5965240	5969260	The idea here is that things that are repeating thematically
5969260	5972860	will show up as different components in different dreams,
5972860	5975500	but that by keeping a dream journal,
5975500	5978200	you can start to identify some of these patterns
5978200	5980940	that are occurring from one dream to the next
5980940	5983380	as opposed to having the same dream over and over.
5983380	5985660	But the point here is that you can explore the contents
5985660	5988140	and the themes, that's really the most important word here,
5988140	5991960	the themes of your unconscious mind that is occurring
5991960	5994540	if you start thinking about what's recurring
5994540	5996440	during your dreams, because dreams are a time
5996440	5999600	when your unconscious mind is dominating the narrative
5999600	6001280	within your mind and brain.
6001280	6002980	Now, for those of you that dream a lot
6002980	6004340	and remember your dreams,
6004340	6006740	as well as for those of you that do not,
6006740	6009960	I would also encourage you to explore the contents
6009960	6013820	of your thinking, that is thinking about your thinking
6013820	6015600	during so-called liminal states.
6015600	6017320	And the liminal state during which this can be
6017320	6020160	particularly useful is right upon waking.
6020160	6021600	So this is different than thinking about
6021600	6023340	what you were dreaming about.
6023340	6026760	This is about keeping your eyes closed and body still.
6026760	6029000	We do think that that's important for doing this well,
6029000	6030340	because once you start moving your body,
6030340	6031760	you open your eyes and you start bringing in
6031760	6033800	sensory experience for that day,
6033800	6036680	your mind dramatically shifts towards conscious processing.
6036680	6040280	But in that liminal state between sleeping and awake,
6040280	6041960	when you wake up and you're a little sleepy,
6041960	6043400	maybe you don't want to get out of bed,
6043400	6045880	and this happens to me all too often,
6045880	6048220	try closing your eyes and remaining perfectly still
6048220	6051360	for maybe one to three minutes, maybe five minutes,
6051360	6054360	and just pay attention to where your mind goes.
6054360	6056720	Now, you might fall back asleep, be mindful of that,
6056720	6059040	depending on what you need to do that morning.
6059040	6063080	But a lot of people will find that their mind goes into
6063080	6065840	this place that's neither sleep nor awake, right?
6065840	6068200	This is a state that very much resembles the state
6068200	6071280	people achieve in things like yoga nidra, yoga sleep,
6071280	6072680	or in non-sleep deep rest,
6072680	6075040	although it tends to be more dominated
6075040	6078080	by the unconscious mind, a little bit more sleep-like.
6078080	6080840	Now, some people find this practice to be difficult
6080840	6082440	because they're the sort of people that wake up
6082440	6084700	and they're just immediately ready to go.
6084700	6086680	Most people, however, myself included,
6086680	6088560	find that when they wake up,
6088560	6090200	the mind isn't completely alert yet,
6090200	6092000	and you can use that period,
6092000	6095560	again, just maybe two or three minutes, maybe five minutes,
6095560	6099980	to start to pay attention to the contents of your thinking,
6099980	6102760	see whether or not your thinking migrates from
6102760	6107760	something related to work or to relationship or to self
6108320	6109640	or to something you want to do
6109640	6113640	or something that you're anxious about and so on and so on.
6113640	6115520	And here too, you'll want to write this down.
6115520	6117380	So this is very much like the dream journaling
6117380	6118600	we just talked about,
6118600	6121400	but it's slightly easier for most people to access,
6121400	6123160	especially people who have a hard time
6123160	6124960	remembering their dreams.
6124960	6127440	And again, it's an opportunity to access
6127440	6129920	some of the contents of your unconscious mind,
6129920	6133360	to learn to look at and see what's going on
6133360	6136360	in your unconscious mind in a way that's very difficult,
6136360	6138040	if not impossible to do,
6138040	6140280	unless you're working with somebody who's very good
6140280	6142360	at accessing the unconscious,
6142360	6145120	such as a skilled psychiatrist or psychoanalyst,
6145120	6148880	and in that way, allowing you to do introspective work,
6148880	6152360	which is not structured in terms of thinking,
6152360	6153800	trying to think about like, what do I want?
6153800	6154960	What's going on?
6154960	6155800	Why did they do that?
6155800	6156920	Why did I react that way?
6156920	6157760	Nothing like that.
6157760	6160240	You're simply observing your mind
6160240	6163260	and seeing what's geysering up from the unconscious.
6163260	6165660	That is, you're getting a portal
6165660	6167660	into that portion of the iceberg
6167660	6170440	that resides below the surface of the water.
6170440	6172440	The next set of tools for exploring the self,
6172440	6174760	self-concept, et cetera,
6174760	6178120	from that four episode series with Dr. Conti is journaling.
6178120	6179520	I'm going to do an entire episode
6179520	6181560	of the Huberman Lab podcast about journaling.
6181560	6183400	And there are a lot of different kinds of journaling
6183400	6185760	and fortunately, there are a lot of great
6185760	6187800	peer-reviewed studies about the power of journaling
6187800	6189280	for processing all sorts of things
6189280	6191800	like emotional states, trauma, et cetera.
6191800	6194240	There are basically two categories of journaling
6194240	6197440	that are very useful to carry out on a consistent basis.
6197440	6199160	And when I say consistent basis,
6199160	6200200	that could mean every day,
6200200	6201440	or it could mean three times a week,
6201440	6203420	it could even be once a week.
6203420	6205320	There are really no hard and fast rules about this,
6205320	6207000	but when we think about journaling,
6207000	6208880	there are really two main styles of journaling.
6208880	6210960	One is going to be free associative journaling.
6210960	6214360	Sometimes people talk about this as a data dump, right?
6214360	6216600	Typically, people will talk about the data dump
6216600	6218120	as the morning notes,
6218120	6220360	which is when you wake up in the morning,
6220360	6221360	you've got a lot on your mind,
6221360	6222600	you can't organize your mind.
6222600	6225240	People who have a hard time structuring their thinking
6225240	6227580	and behavior often find this very useful,
6227580	6230360	which is to take out a journal or a piece of paper.
6230360	6231500	Again, this is just for you.
6231500	6233220	It's important that you realize
6233220	6236640	and really make sure that you're the only person
6236640	6237760	that's going to see these notes,
6237760	6240000	because a lot of people get into self-monitoring
6240000	6241280	when they're doing their journaling.
6241280	6243200	They're thinking about, well, how's this going to look?
6243200	6244180	Is my handwriting okay?
6244180	6245140	How's my punctuation?
6245140	6246360	What are people going to think?
6246360	6248120	Is this going to be a good book or not a good book?
6248120	6250680	Listen, none of this journaling that we're referring to
6250680	6254120	is about your book or your autobiography.
6254120	6256200	This is really just for you.
6256200	6257840	This is an exploration of yourself
6257840	6260600	that's designed to help you enhance your concept,
6260600	6262880	that is your understanding of self,
6262880	6266240	and indeed translates to better confidence,
6266240	6268320	better understanding of your goals and aspirations,
6268320	6270800	better understanding of your unhealthy patterns
6270800	6272560	and defenses and on and on.
6272560	6275280	And so again, the two styles of journaling
6275280	6276560	are free association.
6276560	6278080	So where you literally just write down
6278080	6279840	anything that comes to mind
6279840	6281360	or that you feel like writing down
6281360	6282680	within a given period of time.
6282680	6286220	For most people, 10 minutes is ample time to do that.
6286220	6287700	For some people, five will be enough.
6287700	6291080	And for some who have the time, maybe 30 minutes.
6291080	6293640	But for me, and I think for most people out there,
6293640	6295360	anywhere from five to 10 minutes
6295360	6297600	of this data dump free association,
6297600	6299240	it could be your anxieties, what you're thinking about,
6299240	6300240	what you're anxious about.
6300240	6303200	Really could be about anything that comes to mind.
6303200	6306720	And this free association process can be very useful
6306720	6309680	for clearing out the clutter, so to speak.
6309680	6312400	The other style of journaling that's equally useful,
6312400	6315720	but for different reasons, is structured journaling
6315720	6319420	to have a goal for a given entry on a given day.
6319420	6320680	And again, this could be done in the morning,
6320680	6322000	afternoon or night.
6322000	6325440	And the idea would be that you would set an intention,
6325440	6327960	and by intention, I mean a specific topic
6327960	6330120	that you're going to restrict your writing to.
6330120	6332560	And that writing should be about self,
6332560	6335420	in particular goals and aspirations.
6335420	6338440	What you've wanted in the past, yes,
6338440	6340880	but also what you want at present,
6340880	6343600	what you might want in the future for yourself.
6343600	6345880	These could of course be material things,
6345880	6349320	but in general, this is more about aspirations
6349320	6352580	of things that you would like to accomplish or generate.
6352580	6354160	And the key word there is generate.
6354160	6356120	And if you listen to the four episode series
6356120	6360080	with Dr. Conti, he talked about three drives
6360080	6361480	that exist in all of us.
6361480	6364240	These three drives are the aggressive drive,
6364240	6367200	the pleasure drive and the generative drive.
6367200	6368960	And we don't need to go into a lengthy description
6368960	6370360	about these drives right now.
6370360	6373260	If you're curious about them and what they represent
6373260	6376280	and how they can be in balance or out of balance
6376280	6378200	and how that serves us or doesn't serve us,
6378200	6379960	please check out that four episode series
6379960	6381840	with Dr. Conti, because he goes into that
6381840	6386120	in a fair amount of detail and also in an actionable way.
6386120	6389120	But the key thing here is that we're generative.
6389120	6391520	One of the things that I asked Dr. Conti at the outset
6391520	6394360	and throughout the entire series was,
6394360	6396160	what is mental health?
6396160	6398400	We talk about physical health and we have some idea
6398400	6400800	of what that represents, healthy blood pressure,
6400800	6403120	the ability to do certain forms of physical movement,
6403120	6404760	cognitive abilities.
6404760	6407480	I asked him, how can we define mental health?
6407480	6410200	And his answer was very straightforward and very powerful.
6410200	6414600	He said, what we all need to aspire to is to be in states,
6414600	6418800	that is in the verb actions of agency and gratitude
6418800	6421480	for as much of our waking life as possible.
6421480	6422560	Now that sounds great, right?
6422560	6424840	A sense of agency, the ability to exert influence
6424840	6427960	over our internal state and affect the world around us
6427960	6429880	in positive ways, positive relationships,
6429880	6431880	reach our goals, as well as gratitude,
6431880	6433320	being grateful for the opportunities
6433320	6435560	that we've been afforded, even grateful perhaps
6435560	6437320	for some of the challenges that we've been afforded
6437320	6439400	or that were selected for us
6439400	6441440	that we had no control over
6441440	6444440	and carrying that agency and gratitude forward
6444440	6446680	because it gives rise to a sense of peace,
6446680	6448280	contentment and delight.
6448280	6450440	So all of that sounds wonderful, right?
6450440	6453120	Be in agency and gratitude as a verb states,
6453120	6455440	experience peace, contentment and delight.
6455440	6456760	But Dr. Conti acknowledged,
6456760	6459200	and we spent a good amount of time discussing the fact
6459200	6461760	that doesn't happen just because we decide we want to.
6461760	6464480	In fact, agency and gratitude,
6464480	6466040	peace, contentment and delight,
6466040	6468720	guys are up from a whole set of other processes
6468720	6471560	that we have to engage in on a regular basis.
6471560	6474520	And that really gets us back to those three drives.
6474520	6476440	He talked about how people tend to have
6476440	6478200	more or less aggressive drive,
6478200	6480560	not just aggression in terms of violence,
6480560	6482000	although some people do have that,
6482000	6483880	but in terms of their determination
6483880	6486320	and their sort of leaning into friction,
6486320	6487760	even seeking out a friction.
6487760	6489400	People are on a continuum
6489400	6491000	with respect to the aggressive drive.
6491000	6492800	He also talked about the pleasure drive
6492800	6494600	and the fact that people are on a continuum
6494640	6498920	of the desire for pleasure to either be a hedonist
6498920	6501040	or somebody who really avoids pleasure
6501040	6502920	and kind of restricts pleasure from oneself.
6502920	6505240	And again, that these things can slide around
6505240	6507960	depending on our life circumstances, our age, et cetera,
6507960	6511960	but that it's very important that we have a sense
6511960	6515160	of where we are on that continuum of an aggressive drive
6515160	6516640	and a pleasure drive.
6516640	6519920	And here's the most important thing,
6519920	6522120	that our aggressive drive and pleasure drive
6522120	6525440	never outsize our generative drive.
6525440	6527680	And that engaging our generative drive
6527680	6529640	is really the hallmark of mental health
6529640	6532720	that leads to that sense of agency and gratitude,
6532720	6534320	peace, contentment and delight.
6534320	6537720	And he defined the generative drive in the following way.
6537720	6540240	He said, the generative drive is our desire to create,
6540240	6542880	build and contribute to the world in meaningful ways
6542880	6545440	and appreciate the process to get there.
6545440	6548320	It is the core feature of our mental health.
6548320	6550160	So if you want to learn more about the various drives
6550160	6551880	and how they interact and how to access
6551880	6554880	more generative drive, again, that's all contained
6554880	6557120	in the four episode series with Dr. Conti,
6557120	6559800	but taking us back to the tools and takeaways
6559800	6561600	from that four episode series,
6561600	6564400	the process of journaling in free association mode
6564400	6568280	or the process of journaling in a conscious structured way
6568280	6571760	is really about trying to access the generative drive
6571760	6574480	and to build up that generative drive.
6574480	6577200	And one of the key things about conscious journaling
6577200	6579280	is that it affords us the opportunity
6579280	6582800	in a way that's not going to be seen by anybody else
6582800	6586040	to really think about what our goals and aspirations are.
6586040	6587320	Now you might say, you know,
6587320	6589320	I can't even think about my goals and aspirations.
6589320	6590800	I don't know what I want.
6590800	6591640	Well, that's fine.
6591640	6593000	Then you should journal about that.
6593000	6596720	However, most people have some sense of what they would like,
6596720	6599640	but most people are simply not comfortable
6599640	6602920	with writing those things out or even thinking about them.
6602920	6605240	And if you reflect on that, how could it ever be
6605240	6607640	that you would achieve those goals and aspirations
6607640	6610280	if you're not even feeling comfortable enough
6610280	6612640	to think about them or write about them?
6612640	6614680	And so the process of thinking about
6614680	6617360	and writing about your goals and aspirations
6617360	6620320	is perhaps one of the key first steps
6620320	6623880	towards being able to actualize those goals and aspirations.
6623880	6626280	And for some people, this might be very easy to do.
6626280	6627320	You can simply write down, say,
6627320	6629240	I want to be married by this age,
6629240	6631000	and I want to make X amount of money,
6631000	6632480	and I want to live here or there.
6632480	6635200	And certainly those sorts of goals and aspirations
6635200	6637600	are perfectly valid for this type of exercise,
6638600	6640040	but so are the sorts of goals and aspirations
6640040	6641720	that relate to feeling states.
6641720	6644360	Like, yeah, I would like to feel part of a community.
6644360	6647120	I would like to feel like an active contributor
6647120	6648200	to a community.
6648200	6650240	And then the essential thing is to really flesh out
6650240	6652720	the detail around those goals and aspirations.
6652720	6654160	You know, what size community?
6654160	6656560	Where do you see yourself fitting into this community?
6656560	6659280	Are you doing this alongside other people or by yourself?
6659280	6662040	In other words, to really get comfortable thinking
6662040	6663960	about what your goals and aspirations are,
6663960	6667080	again, completely from the perspective of self
6667080	6669080	and that you are going to be the only person
6669080	6671200	to see this particular document.
6671200	6672640	Now, I will be the first to admit
6672640	6675160	that the exercise that I just described,
6675160	6676960	not the free association journaling,
6676960	6680200	but the structured journaling of goals and aspirations,
6680200	6684080	I and many people find to be difficult to initiate.
6684080	6685880	Difficult to initiate because there seems to be
6685880	6689000	a bit of internal anxiety and friction around doing it.
6689000	6692120	There seems to be something that keeps many, not all,
6692120	6696160	but many people from feeling as if they are even allowed
6696160	6698120	to think about their goals and aspirations
6698120	6700720	because many people default to, well, then, you know,
6700720	6702840	I'll just be disappointed because it's not going to work out.
6702840	6704920	I don't want to think about what I want
6704920	6706800	because then I'll just be more disappointed.
6706800	6709040	And that particular frame of mind was actually discussed
6709040	6710800	in the series with Dr. Conti.
6710800	6714240	And he convinced me, and he's the expert,
6714240	6717340	that the opposite is actually true.
6717340	6719600	When we are able to overcome some of our anxiety
6719600	6721840	and really think about in a dedicated way
6721840	6724200	what we would like to create for ourselves in our lives,
6724200	6725800	both present and future,
6725800	6727980	and keeping in mind our events of past
6727980	6731060	because we always carry that life narrative forward,
6731060	6733120	then we are in a far better place
6733120	6735340	to actualize those goals and aspirations.
6735340	6737720	And he explained a variety of reasons why that's the case
6737720	6739440	in his clinical observations
6739440	6741040	and some of the other observations
6741040	6742400	that really support that statement.
6742400	6745020	So I highly encourage you to think about embracing
6745020	6746060	a process of journaling.
6746060	6747720	Again, you don't have to do this every day.
6747720	6749280	The journaling and the dream analysis
6749280	6750660	take a little bit more time,
6750660	6752460	but they are oh so valuable
6752460	6754820	for better understanding oneself concept.
6754820	6759020	And they really thread forward into real everyday actions
6759020	6762100	that can positively enrich your mood and mental health.
6762100	6764300	Now, any description of science-based tools
6764300	6766620	for mood and mental health would be incomplete
6766620	6770380	without including some tools related to processing of traumas.
6770380	6773260	Now, the processing of traumas is something that,
6773260	6776900	especially in the case of major traumas or repeated traumas,
6776900	6778460	really should be carried out
6778460	6781620	in concert with a expert-trained clinician.
6781620	6783980	That is a psychologist or psychiatrist
6783980	6787780	who's trained in helping people work through traumas.
6787780	6789900	However, even if you're working with somebody
6789900	6791840	who's expert in processing trauma,
6791840	6795020	there are specific tools that you can use on your own
6795020	6797740	to accelerate that process.
6797740	6799540	And for people who are working through
6799540	6801980	what are sometimes called more minor traumas,
6801980	6804060	these are sometimes called big T, big traumas,
6804060	6805540	and little T, little traumas.
6805540	6808380	However, that nomenclature doesn't take into account
6808380	6811340	the fact that most of us can probably tell
6811340	6814300	what the big traumas are for ourselves and for others,
6814300	6815420	but sometimes it's hard to tell
6815420	6817140	whether or not those small traumas,
6817140	6819780	the little T traumas, actually are big T traumas.
6819780	6821900	So this is one of the major reasons
6821900	6823620	why working with a licensed professional
6823620	6825140	is really going to be advantageous
6825140	6827980	and in many cases necessary to work through trauma.
6827980	6831220	That said, the self-directed protocols
6831220	6833300	for working through trauma
6833300	6836220	have a lot to do with how we think about,
6836220	6838100	but more importantly at times,
6838100	6840340	how we talk about those traumas.
6840340	6842020	And Dr. Paul Conte talked about this,
6842020	6844220	not so much in the four episode series with us,
6844220	6846660	but in a particular podcast episode
6846660	6848780	that he did with Dr. Peter Attia,
6848780	6850460	who some of you are perhaps familiar with
6850460	6852820	for his incredible podcast, The Drive,
6852820	6855300	but also for his excellent book, Outlive,
6855300	6858860	which deals with health span and lifespan or longevity.
6858860	6860860	Now, in that particular conversation
6860860	6863340	with Dr. Conte and Dr. Attia,
6863340	6866780	Dr. Conte emphasized the fact that one of the ways
6866780	6868780	that we hold ourselves back
6868860	6872820	and indeed can exacerbate the negative consequences of trauma
6872820	6875700	are the ways in which we modify our language
6875700	6877420	to describe those traumas.
6877420	6879780	And what he said, which is so important,
6879780	6883300	is that oftentimes we don't allow ourselves
6883300	6887100	to use language that's as big as is necessary
6887100	6890300	to explain that trauma and the impact of that trauma
6890300	6892100	on us and on others.
6892100	6896500	In fact, many people start to relegate their language
6896500	6899100	to more passable in a given sentence
6899100	6901300	or passable in a given conversation.
6901300	6904260	Now, what we're not talking about here is the idea that,
6904260	6907020	okay, you know, screaming at somebody else about your trauma
6907020	6908940	or using a lot of four-letter words
6908940	6910340	is necessarily the best way
6910340	6911900	to process that trauma verbally.
6911900	6914820	However, we are talking about allowing oneself,
6914820	6917820	either in spoken form or in written form,
6917820	6920500	to really allow the magnitude of a given trauma
6920500	6924780	to be expressed with a fair degree of intensity
6924780	6928140	and language that can capture at least some
6928140	6931580	of what that trauma represented for us or for others.
6931580	6933660	Now, as Dr. Conte pointed out,
6933660	6935980	all too often we do the opposite.
6935980	6938860	What ends up happening is people will experience
6938860	6941260	some sort of trauma, either major or minor,
6941260	6943380	maybe single or repeated trauma,
6943380	6946540	and rather than being comfortable talking about it,
6946540	6949260	rather than using language that captures at least some
6949260	6952020	of the magnitude of that trauma for them,
6952020	6956220	people start to talk about that trauma less frequently.
6956220	6958460	They start to distract themselves
6958460	6960660	to think about other things instead of talking about
6960660	6962220	or thinking about that trauma.
6962220	6964860	And what happens is that trauma roots
6964860	6966420	into our unconscious mind
6966420	6969380	and starts to impact us in negative ways.
6969380	6973060	Now, those negative ways include increases in anxiety,
6973060	6974580	disruptions in sleep.
6974580	6977220	In fact, one of the common ways in which trauma manifests
6977220	6979500	in disruptions in sleep by way of rooting
6979500	6983660	into our unconscious is that people wake up at 2.30
6983660	6985300	or three o'clock in the morning,
6985300	6987660	let's just say after several hours of being asleep,
6987660	6990140	and immediately they're thinking about that thing
6990140	6992140	that happened and they're upset about it.
6992140	6994780	The idea is that when we push those traumas down,
6994780	6997780	when we don't talk about them with people that we trust,
6997780	6999980	when we don't have a way to consciously process
6999980	7004580	those traumas using language that at least partially matches
7004580	7008180	the magnitude of the impact of those traumas for us,
7008180	7011180	well, then those traumas impact our unconscious mind
7011180	7013260	in ways that lead our unconscious mind
7013260	7015340	to literally wake us up in the middle of the night
7015340	7016980	and remind us of that thing.
7016980	7018980	It's as if it's being thrown back in our face
7018980	7019900	over and over.
7019900	7022180	Also, sometimes traumas will root their way down
7022180	7024980	into our unconscious and then they will resurface
7024980	7028740	in the mode of compulsive or obsessive thinking
7028740	7031180	about that thing or perhaps other things.
7031180	7034700	Again, the unconscious mind has a interesting
7034700	7036820	and complicated number of different ways
7036820	7041820	that it defends us in ways that it can create denial,
7041820	7044580	distraction, that we might get hyper-focused on work
7044580	7046980	as a way to not think about the trauma
7046980	7049500	or hyper-focused on some details in our environment
7049500	7050980	and just really trying to focus on that
7050980	7053180	because it's much easier to process
7053180	7055220	and handle that than these traumas.
7055220	7057660	Again, the processing of trauma is a whole landscape
7057660	7062060	into itself that actually was beautifully described
7062060	7064660	in terms of how it arises within us
7064660	7068220	and how to process traumas in a really structured way
7068220	7071380	in a just fabulous book that was written by Dr. Conti
7071380	7073260	called The Invisible Epidemic,
7073260	7075660	How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It.
7075660	7077860	And in that book, Dr. Conti explains a number
7077860	7080340	of different ways that we can do self-directed work
7080340	7082540	as well as work with licensed professionals
7082540	7085100	to process traumas and help us move through those traumas
7085100	7088540	so that they are not negatively impacting us going forward.
7088540	7091060	So I really encourage anyone that's trying to process traumas
7091060	7094340	from the past and or present to check out Dr. Conti's book
7094340	7096300	because it's a spectacular resource.
7096300	7098700	But in terms of the tools related to processing trauma
7098700	7100620	that we're talking about right now,
7100620	7104100	I think this point about really making sure
7104100	7107620	that we allow ourselves to verbally process
7107620	7109740	and emotionally process that trauma
7109740	7113340	in a way that there's room for using language
7113340	7115940	that captures some of the magnitude of that trauma
7115940	7118460	and how it impacted us and others
7118460	7120340	is going to be very important
7120340	7122700	because otherwise what ends up happening
7122700	7126460	is that we tend to adopt feelings of guilt and shame
7126460	7129780	around those traumas simply by not talking about them,
7129780	7131140	by having them go inward.
7131140	7133540	And then they start to negatively impact
7133540	7135780	our unconscious mind and then our unconscious mind
7135780	7137260	tries to throw them up to the surface
7137260	7138900	for our conscious mind to recognize
7138900	7140740	by waking us up from sleep.
7140740	7144020	And in some cases, by leveraging those unhealthy defenses,
7144020	7147580	things like denial, things like the overindulgence
7147580	7149740	in alcohol, overindulgence of drugs,
7149740	7151580	ways to distract ourselves,
7151580	7153900	as well as projection and sublimation
7153900	7156020	and the other types of defenses
7156020	7158780	that Dr. Conti talked about in the four episode series.
7158780	7162620	Again, those defenses are not necessarily good or bad.
7162620	7164420	It depends on the circumstances.
7164420	7167180	The unconscious mind is not trying to harm us.
7167180	7169460	Your unconscious mind is part of you.
7169460	7170740	It is you.
7170740	7173140	But of course it is you acting in concert
7173140	7174260	with your conscious mind.
7174260	7176260	And so really the tools and protocols
7176260	7178740	from the four episode series with Dr. Conti
7178780	7182060	are aimed at helping you feel and access
7182060	7185260	more sense of agency and gratitude on a regular basis,
7185260	7187620	more peace, contentment and delight.
7187620	7191860	And doing so by touching into those different drives,
7191860	7193420	understanding what they are,
7193420	7195300	the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive,
7195300	7198060	and really making sure that your generative drive,
7198060	7200100	again, I love this description of the generative drive
7200100	7201660	so much so that I'm going to read it again,
7201660	7205500	because this is really what it means to be mentally healthy.
7205500	7207700	Again, the generative drive is our desire
7207700	7209660	to create, build and contribute to the world
7209660	7212780	in a meaningful way and appreciate the process to get there.
7212780	7215580	It is the core feature of our mental health.
7215580	7217940	So being able to access that generative drive
7217940	7220420	on a regular basis is really what this thing
7220420	7223020	that we call mental health is all about.
7223020	7224820	And the tools that I just described,
7224820	7227180	of course can be combined with in any number
7227180	7229060	of different ways with the tools that I described
7229060	7230980	gleaned largely from the episode
7230980	7232540	with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett.
7232540	7236620	And so what you now have is a kit of tools and protocols
7236620	7238100	for improving mood and mental health,
7238100	7240740	some of which are grounded in that core six,
7240740	7243900	the first principles of self care
7243900	7246340	are always going to be getting your physiology right
7246340	7248900	so that your psychology can be right.
7248900	7251620	As well, of course, you want to emphasize tools
7251620	7254900	and protocols that build up your psychological processes
7254900	7256180	and concept of self.
7256180	7258620	That's what the tools from the Conti series
7258620	7260300	that we just described are all about.
7260300	7262700	And then the tools from the episode
7262700	7265220	with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett sort of bridge the two
7265220	7267100	because she talked about both the physiological
7267100	7270940	and the psychological tools that really represent ways
7270940	7272580	to enhance our mood and mental health.
7272580	7275500	And so by threading these three things together,
7275500	7277940	I believe it really arms us with the greatest degree
7277940	7281260	of optimism and capacity to take control of this thing
7281260	7282980	that we call our mood and emotions,
7282980	7285580	and to, of course, allow ourselves to feel
7285580	7286780	the negative things we need to feel,
7286780	7288540	but then process them in healthy ways
7288540	7291460	and to exist as much as is reasonably possible
7291460	7295380	in generally optimistic upbeat states
7295380	7298540	that allow us to engage our generative drive.
7298540	7301660	And although we covered a lot of tools during this episode,
7301660	7303900	again, I want to emphasize that the idea
7303900	7306340	isn't to necessarily do all of them all at once,
7306340	7308460	maybe just pick one or two and start to implement them
7308460	7309820	on a regular basis.
7309820	7312260	And by implementing those, there's no reason to think
7312260	7313940	that you would be significantly eating
7313940	7315900	into your other demands on your time,
7315900	7317740	because ultimately the whole purpose
7317740	7320100	of having elevated mood and mental health
7320100	7322420	is so that you can have better relationship to yourself
7322420	7324220	and better relationship to others
7324220	7325700	and to the world around you.

7356780	7358700	Not so much on today's episode,
7358700	7361260	but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
7361260	7362460	we discussed supplements.
7362460	7364300	While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
7364300	7366620	many people derive tremendous benefit from them
7366620	7370340	for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support, and focus.
7370340	7371940	To learn more about the supplements discussed
7371940	7373500	on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
7373500	7376140	you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,

7390060	7392140	I discuss science and science-related tools,
7392140	7393740	some of which overlaps with the content
7393740	7394980	of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
7394980	7396940	but much of which is distinct from the content
