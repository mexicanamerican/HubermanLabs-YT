00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:03.720
where we discuss science

00:03.720 --> 00:05.920
and science-based tools for everyday life.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.240
I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.240 --> 00:13.240
and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.240 --> 00:15.220
at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.220 --> 00:18.520
Today we are discussing tools for mood and mental health.

00:18.520 --> 00:20.240
I will include tools and resources

00:20.240 --> 00:22.440
taken from the guest episode that I did

00:22.440 --> 00:24.560
with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

00:24.560 --> 00:27.360
who is a psychologist and neuroscientist

00:27.400 --> 00:30.640
whose laboratory focuses on mood and emotions.

00:30.640 --> 00:33.480
During that episode, she mentioned several important tools

00:33.480 --> 00:35.320
that I do believe everybody should apply

00:35.320 --> 00:37.440
and that indeed I've been applying to my own life

00:37.440 --> 00:40.360
and have found to be extremely beneficial.

00:40.360 --> 00:41.240
I will also highlight

00:41.240 --> 00:43.400
some of the specific research articles

00:43.400 --> 00:44.880
those tools are based on,

00:44.880 --> 00:48.480
which were not covered in the podcast with Lisa.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.040
I will also discuss tools gleaned

00:50.040 --> 00:53.160
from the four episode series that I did on mental health

00:53.160 --> 00:54.640
with Dr. Paul Conti,

00:54.640 --> 00:57.680
who is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry.

00:57.680 --> 01:00.240
And that episode, as some of you may already know,

01:00.240 --> 01:02.980
focused on mental health and the self,

01:02.980 --> 01:04.680
as well as relationships.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.200
And it included a deep discussion of what is the self.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.920
We talked about the unconscious mind and the conscious mind.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.680
And we also covered a lot of tools

01:12.680 --> 01:14.360
for understanding oneself,

01:14.360 --> 01:16.340
both within the context of therapy,

01:16.340 --> 01:18.480
but also within the context of things

01:18.480 --> 01:22.620
that one can do alone and that require zero cost.

01:22.620 --> 01:23.900
In addition, we talked about tools

01:23.900 --> 01:25.300
for improving relationships.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.140
We talked about first principles of self care.

01:27.140 --> 01:28.980
So I will provide highlights and takeaways

01:28.980 --> 01:31.300
of those tools during today's episode.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.900
And thirdly, I will include tools,

01:32.900 --> 01:35.300
what we often refer to as protocols,

01:35.300 --> 01:37.340
gleaned from some recent publications.

01:37.340 --> 01:38.940
Indeed, publications that came out

01:38.940 --> 01:41.420
as recently as two weeks ago,

01:41.420 --> 01:45.140
which really emphasize specific things that we can all do

01:45.140 --> 01:47.060
that again are zero cost,

01:47.060 --> 01:50.460
that have been shown in quality peer reviewed research

01:50.460 --> 01:53.520
to significantly improve mood and mental health.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.040
For instance, if you're a regular listener of this podcast,

01:56.040 --> 02:00.520
you are probably familiar with my nearly constant reminder

02:00.520 --> 02:02.520
that people should view morning sunlight

02:02.520 --> 02:03.680
and afternoon sunlight.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.800
And if you can't, to embrace some alternatives

02:06.800 --> 02:08.400
like looking at bright artificial light,

02:08.400 --> 02:10.180
although sunlight is best.

02:10.180 --> 02:11.720
Well, there was a recent paper published

02:11.720 --> 02:15.280
in the journal, Nature Mental Health, an excellent journal,

02:15.280 --> 02:17.720
focusing on not just the positive effects

02:17.720 --> 02:19.440
of viewing light at those times of day

02:19.440 --> 02:21.080
and indeed throughout the day,

02:21.080 --> 02:24.260
but also the independent and positive effects

02:24.260 --> 02:28.280
of being in darkness for six to eight hours every night.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.120
That's right.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.400
Not only is light during the day correlated

02:31.400 --> 02:34.140
with significantly improved mental health outcomes,

02:34.140 --> 02:36.960
but darkness at night that is avoiding lights,

02:36.960 --> 02:41.680
not just bright lights, but lights for up to eight hours

02:41.680 --> 02:44.280
at certain periods of your 24 hour circadian cycle

02:44.280 --> 02:46.920
has been correlated with improved mental health outcomes.

02:46.920 --> 02:50.200
And indeed has been shown to significantly offset

02:50.200 --> 02:53.080
certain negative mental health outcomes.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.200
This is a spectacular study.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.200
Again, it involved a enormous number of research subjects,

02:58.200 --> 03:00.400
more than 85,000 research subjects.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.620
And it touches on a large number of actionable protocols

03:03.620 --> 03:05.780
that I've distilled down to just one or two things

03:05.780 --> 03:08.720
that all of us can easily do to improve our mood

03:08.720 --> 03:10.960
and mental health on a consistent basis.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.680
Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:13.680 --> 03:16.440
is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.740
It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:18.740 --> 03:21.420
to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:21.420 --> 03:24.060
and science related tools to the general public.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.140
In keeping with that theme,

03:25.140 --> 03:27.980
I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.140
Our first sponsor is Plunge.

03:30.140 --> 03:32.620
Plunge makes what I believe is the most versatile

03:32.620 --> 03:34.340
at home self-cooling cold plunge

03:34.340 --> 03:36.220
for deliberate cold exposure.

03:36.220 --> 03:38.740
I've covered the topic of deliberate cold exposure

03:38.740 --> 03:40.220
several times on this podcast.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.660
Indeed, we did an entire episode

03:41.660 --> 03:43.340
about deliberate cold exposure.

03:43.340 --> 03:46.020
And what's very clear from the research literature

03:46.020 --> 03:48.300
is that deliberate cold exposure

03:48.300 --> 03:51.240
can induce dramatic positive shifts

03:51.240 --> 03:53.340
in so-called catecholamines.

03:53.340 --> 03:56.660
That is dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine.

03:56.660 --> 03:58.500
This is a small collection of molecules

03:58.500 --> 03:59.920
that are released in the brain and body

03:59.920 --> 04:01.780
when we do deliberate cold exposure.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.300
And that subjectively lead to greatly enhanced feelings

04:05.300 --> 04:09.040
of mood alertness and focus for many hours afterwards.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.540
That's perhaps the best substantiated reason

04:11.540 --> 04:13.120
and the most popular reason

04:13.120 --> 04:15.740
why people who get into deliberate cold exposure,

04:15.740 --> 04:17.040
no pun intended,

04:17.040 --> 04:19.020
continue to do deliberate cold exposure

04:19.020 --> 04:20.340
on a consistent basis.

04:20.340 --> 04:23.060
Plunge uses a powerful and very easy to use

04:23.060 --> 04:24.980
cooling filtration and sanitation unit

04:24.980 --> 04:26.860
to give you access to deliberate cold exposure

04:26.860 --> 04:28.900
in clean water whenever you want.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.780
I've used a Plunge for several years now,

04:30.780 --> 04:32.920
and I really like it because first of all,

04:32.920 --> 04:34.500
it can use a standard outlet.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.080
You don't have to modify the electricity

04:36.080 --> 04:38.940
in your home or yard, and it's very easy to clean.

04:38.940 --> 04:41.540
In fact, it stays clean for long periods of time,

04:41.540 --> 04:44.140
which makes it very easy to maintain as well.

04:44.140 --> 04:45.480
Plunge has several different models

04:45.480 --> 04:49.060
to select from, including their new all-in cold Plunge,

04:49.060 --> 04:50.440
which offers faster cooling,

04:50.440 --> 04:52.700
smartphone connectivity, and more.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.060
If you're interested in getting a Plunge,

04:54.060 --> 04:59.060
you can go to Plunge, spelled P-L-U-N-G-E.com slash Huberman

04:59.580 --> 05:01.600
to get $150 off your cold Plunge.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.040
Again, that's plunge.com slash Huberman to get $150 off.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.900
Today's episode is also brought to us by 8 Sleep.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.080
8 Sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling,

05:11.080 --> 05:13.360
heating, and sleep tracking capacity.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.360
I've spoken many times before in this podcast

05:15.360 --> 05:16.740
about the fact that sleep,

05:16.740 --> 05:20.000
that is getting enough quality sleep on a consistent basis,

05:20.000 --> 05:21.480
is the foundation of mental health,

05:21.480 --> 05:22.840
physical health, and performance.

05:22.840 --> 05:23.680
Now, one of the key things

05:23.680 --> 05:25.720
to getting the best possible night's sleep

05:25.720 --> 05:28.020
is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment,

05:28.020 --> 05:31.020
and that's because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep,

05:31.020 --> 05:32.600
your body temperature needs to drop

05:32.600 --> 05:34.360
by about one to three degrees.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.040
And in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized,

05:37.040 --> 05:39.080
your body temperature actually has to increase

05:39.080 --> 05:40.760
by about one to three degrees.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.400
With 8 Sleep, controlling the temperature

05:42.400 --> 05:45.080
of your sleeping environment is made extremely easy.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.360
8 Sleep mattress covers allow you to program

05:47.360 --> 05:48.680
the temperature of your sleeping environment

05:48.680 --> 05:50.860
at the beginning, middle, and end of your night.

05:50.860 --> 05:52.120
It can even divide the temperature

05:52.120 --> 05:54.080
on the two sides of the bed for different people.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.680
It also has sleep tracking capacity.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.200
It will tell you how much slow wave sleep

05:57.200 --> 05:58.840
and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting,

05:58.840 --> 06:01.440
and really help you dial in the exact parameters

06:01.440 --> 06:03.680
so you can get the best possible night's sleep.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.360
I've been sleeping on an 8 Sleep mattress cover

06:05.360 --> 06:06.840
for well over two years now,

06:06.840 --> 06:09.040
and it has significantly improved my sleep,

06:09.040 --> 06:12.240
and therefore my daytime mood focus and alertness.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.520
If you'd like to try 8 Sleep,

06:13.520 --> 06:16.080
you can go to 8sleep.com slash Huberman

06:16.080 --> 06:19.480
and save up to $150 off their pod three covers.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.040
8 Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,

06:22.040 --> 06:24.080
select countries in the EU, and Australia.

06:24.080 --> 06:27.320
Again, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.360
Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.

06:30.360 --> 06:32.120
Waking Up is a meditation app

06:32.120 --> 06:34.280
that includes hundreds of meditation programs,

06:34.280 --> 06:36.680
mindfulness trainings, yoga nidra sessions,

06:36.680 --> 06:39.720
and NSDR, non-sleep deep rest protocols.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.040
I started using the Waking Up app a few years ago

06:42.040 --> 06:44.760
because even though I've been doing regular meditation

06:44.760 --> 06:47.840
since my teens, and I started doing yoga nidra

06:47.840 --> 06:50.720
about a decade ago, my dad mentioned to me

06:50.720 --> 06:51.960
that he had found an app,

06:51.960 --> 06:53.720
turned out to be the Waking Up app,

06:53.720 --> 06:56.760
which could teach you meditations of different durations

06:56.760 --> 06:59.240
and that had a lot of different types of meditations

06:59.240 --> 07:01.800
to place the brain and body into different states,

07:01.800 --> 07:03.120
and that he liked it very much.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.440
So I gave the Waking Up app a try,

07:05.440 --> 07:07.880
and I too found it to be extremely useful

07:07.880 --> 07:10.920
because sometimes I only have a few minutes to meditate,

07:10.920 --> 07:12.640
other times I have longer to meditate,

07:12.640 --> 07:14.520
and indeed I love the fact that I can explore

07:14.520 --> 07:16.360
different types of meditation

07:16.360 --> 07:18.560
to bring about different levels of understanding

07:18.560 --> 07:21.120
about consciousness, but also to place my brain and body

07:21.120 --> 07:22.760
into lots of different kinds of states

07:22.760 --> 07:24.760
depending on which meditation I do.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.280
I also love that the Waking Up app

07:26.280 --> 07:28.960
has lots of different types of yoga nidra sessions.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.120
For those of you who don't know,

07:30.120 --> 07:32.680
yoga nidra is a process of lying very still,

07:32.680 --> 07:33.960
but keeping an active mind.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.120
It's very different than most meditations,

07:36.120 --> 07:38.200
and there's excellent scientific data

07:38.200 --> 07:40.800
to show that yoga nidra and something similar to it

07:41.360 --> 07:43.480
called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR

07:43.480 --> 07:46.520
can greatly restore levels of cognitive and physical energy

07:46.520 --> 07:49.000
even with just a short 10 minute session.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.920
If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,

07:50.920 --> 07:53.800
you can go to wakingup.com slash Huberman

07:53.800 --> 07:55.840
and access a free 30 day trial.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.680
Again, that's wakingup.com slash Huberman

07:58.680 --> 08:01.040
to access a free 30 day trial.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.400
Okay, let's talk about tools

08:02.400 --> 08:04.960
for improving mood and mental health.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.160
I think it goes without saying

08:06.160 --> 08:09.200
that these are extremely important topics

08:09.200 --> 08:11.640
for everyone not just to know about,

08:11.640 --> 08:15.080
but in my opinion, also for people to implement.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.800
And the reason is that we are currently

08:16.800 --> 08:19.800
in a worldwide mental health crisis.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.440
And while we could debate the reason

08:21.440 --> 08:24.000
why we are in a worldwide mental health crisis,

08:24.000 --> 08:27.760
it's very, very clear that mood disorders

08:27.760 --> 08:29.840
and challenges with mental health abound.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.600
And of course, there are many different therapies

08:31.600 --> 08:34.160
for the treatment of mood disorders and mental health,

08:34.160 --> 08:36.240
everything from talk therapy with a psychologist

08:36.240 --> 08:39.640
or a psychiatrist or social worker,

08:39.640 --> 08:41.040
prescription drug treatments,

08:41.040 --> 08:43.680
their nutritional approaches, somatic approaches.

08:43.680 --> 08:45.680
And I want to be clear that I do believe

08:45.680 --> 08:48.040
that there's value in all of these approaches.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.600
What tends to matter in terms of what sorts of tools

08:51.600 --> 08:56.480
and approaches one adopts includes both access,

08:56.480 --> 08:57.720
so whether or not people have access

08:57.720 --> 08:58.680
to these types of therapies,

08:58.680 --> 09:00.920
whether or not they can afford them on a consistent basis,

09:00.920 --> 09:03.160
and also, of course, the severity of the mood

09:03.160 --> 09:04.640
or mental health disorder.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.200
And I'd be remiss, of course,

09:06.200 --> 09:07.400
if I didn't make the statement,

09:07.400 --> 09:09.160
and I don't say this just to protect me,

09:09.160 --> 09:10.880
I also say this to protect all of you

09:10.880 --> 09:12.160
and those that you know,

09:12.160 --> 09:15.000
that if you are concerned about yourself or somebody else

09:15.000 --> 09:18.160
having a serious mood or mental health disorder,

09:18.160 --> 09:20.880
please do seek out help from a licensed clinical psychologist

09:20.880 --> 09:23.320
or psychiatrist or other healthcare professional

09:23.320 --> 09:26.120
who's qualified to help you in that regard.

09:26.120 --> 09:27.920
With that said, we can now have a discussion

09:27.920 --> 09:30.000
about tools and protocols for enhancing mood

09:30.000 --> 09:32.600
and mental health that truly apply to everybody,

09:32.600 --> 09:34.360
regardless of age.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.120
To start off, I wanna talk about a fundamental aspect

09:37.120 --> 09:39.720
of mood and mental health enhancement

09:39.720 --> 09:41.920
that was discussed both in the guest episode

09:41.920 --> 09:43.520
with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

09:43.520 --> 09:46.640
as well as in the guest series with Dr. Paul Conti.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.880
And that has to do with what Dr. Paul Conti referred to

09:49.880 --> 09:54.400
as the first principles of self-care or mental health.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.400
The first principles of self-care include,

09:56.400 --> 09:57.920
but are not limited to,

09:57.920 --> 10:00.640
taking excellent care of one's biology,

10:00.640 --> 10:03.560
which of course includes both the mind and the body.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.680
And in order to make this very simple and actionable,

10:06.680 --> 10:10.480
I've distilled out what I refer to as the big six.

10:10.480 --> 10:11.640
I've sometimes referred to these

10:11.640 --> 10:14.440
as the six major pillars of health,

10:14.440 --> 10:16.280
both mental health and physical health,

10:16.280 --> 10:18.480
as well as performance for that matter.

10:18.480 --> 10:20.120
But if we're going to talk about tools

10:20.120 --> 10:21.880
for mood and mental health,

10:21.880 --> 10:26.240
we absolutely can't discard discussions about our biology.

10:26.240 --> 10:29.000
That is, we need to make sure that we're taking care

10:29.000 --> 10:30.960
of our normal biological function

10:30.960 --> 10:33.880
and indeed enhancing the production

10:33.880 --> 10:36.920
of specific neurotransmitters and neuromodulators

10:36.920 --> 10:38.360
that we are optimizing.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.240
Yes, I use the word optimizing.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.400
The function of our so-called autonomic nervous system,

10:43.400 --> 10:44.840
that aspect of our nervous system

10:44.840 --> 10:46.880
that's humming in the background all the time.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.160
It's operating unconsciously

10:48.160 --> 10:50.720
to regulate our sleep-wake cycles.

10:50.720 --> 10:55.720
It's regulating how well or poorly we react to things.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.120
It's regulating how much dopamine, serotonin,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.160
epinephrine, acetylcholine we're producing.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.280
All of this stuff is humming in the background

11:03.280 --> 11:06.000
and sets the stage for all the conscious work

11:06.000 --> 11:08.080
that we might put to, for instance,

11:08.080 --> 11:11.480
trying to understand what our life narrative is,

11:11.480 --> 11:14.040
what our unconscious mind is doing,

11:14.040 --> 11:15.880
what sorts of defenses am I producing,

11:15.880 --> 11:18.160
all of the sort of high-level and directed work

11:18.160 --> 11:19.960
that we're going to talk about a little bit later

11:19.960 --> 11:23.240
exists on a background of autonomic function,

11:23.240 --> 11:26.880
of neurotransmitter production, of hormone production,

11:26.880 --> 11:28.360
not just testosterone and estrogen,

11:28.360 --> 11:31.440
but things like cortisol, prolactin and on and on.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.920
So it's important to understand that if our goal

11:33.920 --> 11:36.320
is to be in the best possible mood

11:36.320 --> 11:37.720
given our life circumstances

11:37.720 --> 11:40.520
and to have the best possible mental health

11:40.520 --> 11:41.880
given our life circumstances

11:41.880 --> 11:44.240
and to improve our mood and mental health

11:44.240 --> 11:45.680
consistently over time,

11:45.680 --> 11:48.600
that we have to pay attention to what I'm referring to here

11:48.600 --> 11:52.720
as the big six or the six pillars of mental health.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.760
And those are, just to list them off,

11:54.760 --> 11:57.040
then I'll go into a little bit more detail,

11:57.080 --> 12:01.720
sleep, sunlight, although I'd like to modify sunlight

12:01.720 --> 12:02.960
because based on some new data

12:02.960 --> 12:04.480
that just came out a couple of weeks ago,

12:04.480 --> 12:08.200
I'd like to now make that second pillar,

12:08.200 --> 12:11.680
not sunlight, but light slash dark.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.880
So we could even just think about it as a light,

12:13.880 --> 12:15.360
when and how much light you get.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.040
But what you'll soon learn is that how much dark you get

12:19.040 --> 12:20.680
is also extremely important.

12:20.680 --> 12:25.560
So we've got sleep, light, movement is the third,

12:25.560 --> 12:29.320
nutrition, social connection, and stress control.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.000
Now, these are topics that I've spoken about extensively

12:32.000 --> 12:34.480
on previous Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.240
So I don't want to go into a deep dive

12:36.240 --> 12:38.760
of each of these six pillars right now,

12:38.760 --> 12:41.560
but I am going to just give you a few highlights of each.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.120
And then of course, we will provide links

12:43.120 --> 12:44.280
in the show note captions

12:44.280 --> 12:46.480
for which you can go on the deep dive if you like.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.920
And I also would like to mention that

12:47.920 --> 12:50.560
if you ever have questions about specific protocols

12:50.560 --> 12:52.560
or tools and you're seeking those out

12:52.560 --> 12:55.440
to our previous episodes or specific timestamps

12:55.440 --> 12:57.400
of previous episodes of this podcast,

12:57.400 --> 13:00.760
you can go to our newly revamped hubermanlab.com website

13:00.760 --> 13:02.520
and put any topic of interest

13:02.520 --> 13:05.320
or even several topics of interest into the search function.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.760
And it will take you to the very specific timestamps

13:07.760 --> 13:11.800
and other resources that provide information on those topics.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.120
So I'm going to go into a few of the key bullet points

13:14.120 --> 13:15.960
about each of the six pillars,

13:15.960 --> 13:18.160
or what I also refer to as the big six

13:18.160 --> 13:20.040
of self-care and mental health.

13:20.040 --> 13:24.680
Again, this is a necessary list, but is not sufficient.

13:24.680 --> 13:29.240
Again, necessary to do these things every 24 hours,

13:29.240 --> 13:31.240
indeed, every 24 hours,

13:31.240 --> 13:33.460
if you want to have the best possible mood

13:33.460 --> 13:37.000
and mental health, but it is not sufficient.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.760
That means you still need to do some of the other things

13:39.760 --> 13:41.240
that we're going to talk about

13:41.240 --> 13:43.240
in terms of directed approaches

13:43.240 --> 13:45.200
at improving mood and mental health.

13:45.200 --> 13:47.080
If you are to quote unquote,

13:47.080 --> 13:48.800
optimize your mood and mental health,

13:48.800 --> 13:50.160
or if you are, let's just say,

13:50.160 --> 13:53.600
trying to constantly improve your mood and mental health.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.160
But these are the necessary,

13:55.160 --> 13:58.680
but not sufficient pillars of mental health.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.520
So under the heading of sleep,

14:00.520 --> 14:01.960
it's safe to say that most people need

14:01.960 --> 14:04.920
between six to eight hours of sleep per night.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.620
Some people can get away with five.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.880
Some people need as much as nine or 10.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.920
Certainly growing kids, babies, teenagers,

14:12.920 --> 14:15.880
and those that are suffering from some sort of illness

14:15.880 --> 14:18.680
are going to need more, as much as nine, 10,

14:18.680 --> 14:20.980
maybe even 12 hours of sleep per night.

14:20.980 --> 14:23.480
However, most people do well to get somewhere

14:23.480 --> 14:25.920
between six and eight hours of sleep per night.

14:25.920 --> 14:27.420
You're just going to have to experiment

14:27.420 --> 14:29.800
and figure out what's best for you.

14:29.800 --> 14:30.960
Now, one thing I heard recently,

14:30.960 --> 14:33.320
so I can't claim this as an original idea,

14:33.320 --> 14:36.460
but that I think is a really good way to think about sleep,

14:36.460 --> 14:39.220
is that sleep, much like physical fitness,

14:39.220 --> 14:41.920
is something that we have to constantly be working on.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.840
It's not the sort of thing

14:42.840 --> 14:44.560
where you can get a great night's sleep one night,

14:44.560 --> 14:45.600
and then the next night,

14:45.600 --> 14:47.480
just kind of let all the protocols go

14:47.480 --> 14:49.400
and expect to get a great night's sleep.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.600
You don't have to be neurotic

14:50.600 --> 14:51.840
about getting a great night's sleep.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.940
Indeed, I do believe that we should strive

14:53.940 --> 14:55.880
to get enough quality sleep

14:55.880 --> 14:58.160
as many of the nights of our life as possible,

14:58.160 --> 15:00.320
and if you can't do that, hopefully it's for good reasons,

15:00.320 --> 15:02.840
but of course, things happen in life, raising kids,

15:02.840 --> 15:05.120
you have emergencies, all-nighters to study,

15:05.120 --> 15:07.480
so you can make sure you get that best possible grade

15:07.480 --> 15:08.900
on an exam, et cetera, et cetera,

15:08.900 --> 15:12.060
but we should all strive to get the best quality sleep

15:12.060 --> 15:15.340
that we can, and as much of it, most nights of our lives.

15:15.340 --> 15:17.600
So it's important to look at sleep as a process

15:17.600 --> 15:18.940
that you're going to be working on

15:18.940 --> 15:20.940
for the rest of your life, just like fitness,

15:20.940 --> 15:22.380
and I don't say that to overwhelm you,

15:22.380 --> 15:25.360
I say that so that if on any given night

15:25.360 --> 15:26.600
you get a poor night's sleep,

15:26.600 --> 15:28.100
you don't stress that too much,

15:28.100 --> 15:29.580
you just get right back on the wagon

15:29.580 --> 15:32.180
and you try and get the best possible night's sleep

15:32.180 --> 15:34.820
the next night and the next night and the next night,

15:34.820 --> 15:35.820
much like fitness.

15:35.820 --> 15:37.900
There's no 10-week program

15:37.900 --> 15:41.580
that's going to transform your physical fitness forever,

15:41.580 --> 15:42.980
just like there's no sleep program

15:42.980 --> 15:44.600
that's going to transform your sleep forever.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.520
It's a daily or rather, I should say, nightly investment,

15:47.520 --> 15:48.360
although some of the things

15:48.360 --> 15:50.800
that are going to positively impact your sleep

15:50.800 --> 15:52.400
or perhaps damage your sleep

15:52.400 --> 15:53.960
are things that you do during the daytime, right?

15:53.960 --> 15:55.880
So avoid that caffeine too late in the day,

15:55.880 --> 15:57.920
get that morning sunlight and on and on,

15:57.920 --> 15:59.200
but view sleep as something

15:59.200 --> 16:01.240
that you're constantly investing in,

16:01.240 --> 16:03.660
and it is a critical investment

16:03.660 --> 16:05.280
for your mood and mental health.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.800
The other thing that's not often discussed,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.680
and I really haven't talked about terribly much

16:08.680 --> 16:10.360
on this podcast, is the importance

16:10.360 --> 16:13.520
of having a fairly consistent sleep routine.

16:13.520 --> 16:16.320
Now, I realize that not everybody can get to sleep

16:16.320 --> 16:17.880
at the exact same time each night

16:17.880 --> 16:20.040
and wake up at the exact same time each morning,

16:20.040 --> 16:22.160
and frankly, that's not practical.

16:22.160 --> 16:23.560
I certainly don't do that.

16:23.560 --> 16:27.440
However, what we know from the circadian health literature

16:27.440 --> 16:29.400
is that everybody should strive,

16:29.400 --> 16:31.000
again, that's strive, nobody's perfect,

16:31.000 --> 16:32.080
but strive to get to sleep

16:32.080 --> 16:34.400
at more or less the same time each night

16:34.400 --> 16:37.880
and wake up at more or less the same time each morning.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.600
This turns out to be really important

16:39.600 --> 16:42.080
for regulating mood and mental health,

16:42.080 --> 16:45.480
and indeed for improving your overall levels of sleep,

16:45.480 --> 16:48.040
getting the optimal amounts of slow wave sleep,

16:48.040 --> 16:50.520
aka deep sleep and rapid eye movement sleep.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.000
And what we know is that ideally you're going to get

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
to sleep within plus or minus one hour

16:56.000 --> 16:57.280
of your regular sleep time.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.680
So if your regular two bed time is 10 o'clock,

16:59.680 --> 17:01.120
you're used to getting in bed at 10 o'clock

17:01.120 --> 17:03.640
and falling asleep somewhere around 10.30.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.760
Well, then if the next night you fall asleep at 9.30, great.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.080
You're still within the plus or minus one hour.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.520
And if the next night you go to sleep

17:11.520 --> 17:14.640
and you don't fall asleep till 11.30, don't sweat it.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.360
In fact, you're still within that plus or minus one hour.

17:17.360 --> 17:19.680
However, if you start getting into a habit

17:19.680 --> 17:21.920
of going to bed at vastly different times,

17:21.920 --> 17:24.120
deviating more than or less than one hour

17:24.120 --> 17:26.320
from your normal to bed time,

17:26.320 --> 17:28.280
well, then you're going to start to run into issues

17:28.280 --> 17:30.080
such as waking up feeling groggy,

17:30.080 --> 17:32.040
even if you got enough sleep.

17:32.040 --> 17:34.000
So even if you slept the full eight hours

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
that you're used to getting,

17:35.000 --> 17:37.080
people who go to sleep much later than they normally do

17:37.080 --> 17:38.720
or much earlier than they normally do

17:38.720 --> 17:41.840
start getting into kind of issues of mood regulation,

17:41.840 --> 17:43.640
energy regulation, not just in the morning,

17:43.640 --> 17:44.720
but in the afternoon.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.440
Likewise, try and wake up at more or less the same time

17:47.440 --> 17:49.520
each morning, plus or minus one hour.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.240
That's really going to help you anchor

17:51.240 --> 17:52.800
your overall sleep schedule.

17:52.800 --> 17:56.040
And it's really going to help lead to predictability

17:56.040 --> 17:58.520
of your overall levels of energy, mood

17:58.520 --> 18:00.040
and focus throughout the day.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.880
The second pillar in that big six is light.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.480
And I used to refer to this as sunlight, right?

18:05.480 --> 18:07.320
I'd say, and I'm going to say it again now,

18:07.320 --> 18:08.920
although I've covered this in a lot more detail.

18:08.920 --> 18:12.080
So again, just hitting the top contour critical elements,

18:12.920 --> 18:16.040
try to view sunlight, that is with your eyes,

18:16.040 --> 18:19.720
view sunlight as early as possible after waking.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.760
Whenever I say that, the most common question I get is,

18:21.760 --> 18:23.800
what do I do if I wake up before the sun comes out?

18:23.800 --> 18:26.680
Well, unless you have superpowers that I'm not aware of,

18:26.680 --> 18:28.440
you can't make the sun come out any earlier.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.320
So just flip on artificial lights as needed

18:31.320 --> 18:34.520
until the sun comes out and then get outside,

18:34.560 --> 18:37.920
face east in the morning, take off those sunglasses.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.600
It's perfectly safe to look at low solar angle sunlight

18:40.600 --> 18:43.040
without sunglasses, providing you're not driving

18:43.040 --> 18:45.120
into bright light and you crash, this kind of thing.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.840
Get outside, look at the sunlight,

18:47.840 --> 18:50.840
definitely blink to protect your eyes as needed,

18:50.840 --> 18:53.480
but get that sunlight in your eyes early in the day.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.600
This has myriad positive effects on mood focus

18:56.600 --> 18:59.640
and alertness and nighttime sleep later that night.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.520
And it does so through a number of well-defined biological

19:02.520 --> 19:04.960
and endocrine hormonal pathways that I've discussed

19:04.960 --> 19:07.280
on many previous podcast episodes.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.920
And you want to do this for about 10 minutes

19:09.920 --> 19:13.720
on non-overcast days and as long as 20 or 30 minutes

19:13.720 --> 19:15.240
on overcast days.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.560
And that highlights the second most common question I get,

19:17.560 --> 19:20.120
which is, what do I do if there's no sun where I live?

19:20.120 --> 19:22.040
I live in an area where there's no sunlight.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.640
Look, if you live on planet earth, there's always sunlight.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.000
There might not be very much of it.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.840
That might be very overcast where you live.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.320
It might seem very dark, but trust me,

19:30.320 --> 19:33.080
there's far more photons, light energy coming

19:33.080 --> 19:34.240
through that cloud cover,

19:34.240 --> 19:36.880
even in the darkest mornings of winter,

19:36.880 --> 19:40.800
than there are at night in those dark winters.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.880
So get that light in your eyes

19:42.880 --> 19:44.560
and do it as consistently as possible

19:44.560 --> 19:47.040
and also do that in the late afternoon and evening.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.640
That's critical for regulating your circadian clock

19:49.640 --> 19:51.680
for reasons that I've talked about previously,

19:51.680 --> 19:53.360
but I'll get into in a future podcast,

19:53.360 --> 19:55.360
really explaining how those clock oscillators

19:55.360 --> 19:56.640
and mechanisms work.

19:56.640 --> 19:57.920
But just to keep it really simple,

19:57.920 --> 19:59.640
since this is a toolkit episode

19:59.640 --> 20:01.120
for mood and mental health,

20:01.120 --> 20:04.920
your mood and your mental health will benefit tremendously

20:04.920 --> 20:06.880
from getting morning sunlight in your eyes.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.520
Now, if you need to get more light in your eyes,

20:09.520 --> 20:11.680
because indeed there's just not enough sunlight

20:11.680 --> 20:14.200
or you don't have the opportunity to get outside

20:14.200 --> 20:17.360
and view sunlight in the morning for whatever reason,

20:17.360 --> 20:20.840
you might invest in getting a bright light source

20:20.840 --> 20:21.680
that you can plug in.

20:21.680 --> 20:24.760
You probably want one that's as bright as 10,000 lux.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.280
So that's pretty bright.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.720
Those fall under the category of so-called SAD lamps,

20:29.200 --> 20:31.240
seasonal effective disorder lamps.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.480
And you can purchase those.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.160
They can be somewhat expensive.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.580
You can also opt to get a 900 lux drawing tablet.

20:37.580 --> 20:39.240
By the way, I have no financial relationship

20:39.240 --> 20:41.400
to any of these sorts of light sources,

20:41.400 --> 20:42.960
but you can find them pretty easily.

20:42.960 --> 20:46.560
And in the case of the 900 lux light tablet,

20:46.560 --> 20:48.000
fairly inexpensively online.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.380
And you can put that on your desk

20:49.380 --> 20:51.640
or where you have your morning coffee

20:51.640 --> 20:53.440
and try and enhance the total amount of light

20:53.440 --> 20:55.200
that you're getting in the morning.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.680
But frankly, nothing is as good as sunlight.

20:57.680 --> 20:58.900
So if you can't get sunlight,

20:58.900 --> 21:01.640
you might think about investing in one of those SAD lamps.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.160
And indeed those SAD lamps aren't as good as sunlight,

21:04.160 --> 21:05.480
but they are the next best thing

21:05.480 --> 21:08.300
if you really can't get sunlight on a consistent basis.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.760
A few other fine points that I always get asked about.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.000
First of all, it is absolutely okay

21:13.000 --> 21:15.400
to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.640
Those sorts of corrective lenses

21:16.640 --> 21:18.360
are actually going to focus the light to your retina,

21:18.360 --> 21:19.320
which is where you want it.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.700
However, this whole process of viewing morning sunlight

21:22.700 --> 21:25.240
in afternoon light does not, again,

21:25.240 --> 21:27.680
does not work through a window or windshield

21:27.680 --> 21:29.320
because windows and windshields

21:29.320 --> 21:31.360
filter out the relevant wavelengths of light

21:31.360 --> 21:33.680
that you want to get directly onto your retina.

21:33.680 --> 21:35.800
Okay, so that's the reality of it.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.360
In addition, please don't feel

21:37.360 --> 21:39.120
that you have to look directly at the sun

21:39.120 --> 21:41.080
and certainly don't stare at the sun.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.040
Never force yourself to look at any light,

21:43.040 --> 21:44.140
sunlight or otherwise,

21:44.140 --> 21:46.440
that's so bright that it's painful to look at.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.000
So if it's comfortable for you to look directly at the sun

21:49.000 --> 21:50.200
and just blink every once in a while

21:50.200 --> 21:52.300
and you can do that without any pain or discomfort

21:52.300 --> 21:54.320
or watering of the eyes, please do that.

21:54.320 --> 21:56.880
You're getting a lot of photons into your eyes

21:56.880 --> 21:58.400
and they're transmitting that to your brain

21:58.400 --> 22:00.920
and your brain to the rest of your body and on and on.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.380
However, if you find it uncomfortable

22:02.380 --> 22:03.720
to look directly at the sun,

22:03.720 --> 22:06.560
in that case, what you'll want to do is offset your gaze

22:06.560 --> 22:08.880
to 10 or 20 degrees, which is nerd speak

22:08.880 --> 22:10.160
for just a little bit to the right

22:10.160 --> 22:11.560
or a little bit to the left

22:11.560 --> 22:15.000
and get the sunlight into your eyes indirectly.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.480
Okay, and I often also get asked,

22:17.480 --> 22:19.200
well, can I stand in the shade while I do this?

22:19.200 --> 22:21.580
What if I have an overhang in my apartment?

22:21.580 --> 22:23.400
The best thing is of course going to be

22:23.400 --> 22:24.880
to face directly to the sun

22:24.880 --> 22:27.480
and look either directly at it or slightly offset.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.620
But if you can only get morning sunlight

22:29.620 --> 22:31.160
by going out onto your balcony

22:31.160 --> 22:33.960
and your balcony doesn't face east, rather it faces west,

22:33.960 --> 22:36.320
you'll still get a lot of photons from the sun

22:36.320 --> 22:37.480
reaching your eyes there.

22:37.480 --> 22:41.960
But ideally you would find some way to look toward the sun

22:41.960 --> 22:43.020
first thing in the morning.

22:43.020 --> 22:45.180
I realized that with kids and work and other obligations,

22:45.180 --> 22:46.180
this can be challenging,

22:46.180 --> 22:49.580
but it is a challenge worth meeting.

22:49.580 --> 22:51.320
Meaning don't lose your job

22:51.320 --> 22:53.180
or forget to take care of your kids to do this,

22:53.180 --> 22:55.180
but you can bring your kids to do this.

22:55.180 --> 22:58.280
And indeed you should, it sets their circadian rhythms also.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.660
And people often will ask, well, does it work on dogs?

23:01.660 --> 23:03.940
You know, and indeed dogs and other animals

23:03.940 --> 23:05.740
have these exact same circuits and pathways

23:05.740 --> 23:07.200
for setting their circadian rhythm.

23:07.200 --> 23:08.780
So it's great for them too.

23:08.780 --> 23:11.520
Now there are also clear and documented benefits

23:11.520 --> 23:12.620
for mood and mental health

23:12.620 --> 23:14.020
to getting bright light in your eyes,

23:14.020 --> 23:16.340
ideally from sunlight throughout the day,

23:16.340 --> 23:17.600
as much as you safely can.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.180
Please don't get sunburned,

23:19.180 --> 23:22.500
don't get cataracts by getting too much sunlight,

23:22.500 --> 23:24.580
but getting outdoors and getting sunlight in your eyes

23:24.580 --> 23:27.140
during your lunch break or a walk here and there,

23:27.140 --> 23:30.060
or if you have to remain indoors during the day,

23:30.060 --> 23:33.280
getting the lights in that environment as bright as possible

23:33.280 --> 23:35.120
as is safely possible, I should say,

23:35.120 --> 23:37.800
is known to improve mood and mental health.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.640
Why?

23:38.640 --> 23:41.240
Well, because there's a special so-called opsin

23:41.240 --> 23:43.900
within the cells of your eyes called melanopsin

23:43.900 --> 23:47.580
that doesn't respond to the same differences in color

23:47.580 --> 23:50.220
that are present in sunlight in the morning and the evening,

23:50.220 --> 23:53.540
but rather responds to the overall brightness of light.

23:53.540 --> 23:56.180
So very bright lights, either from artificial sources

23:56.180 --> 23:58.660
or ideally from sunlight, activate these cells

23:58.660 --> 24:01.180
and these cells project these little wires,

24:01.180 --> 24:03.820
we call axons, into specific parts of the brain

24:03.820 --> 24:06.980
that improve your mood and feelings of wellbeing.

24:06.980 --> 24:10.660
So I can't give you a specific number

24:10.660 --> 24:12.680
of five minutes a day or 10 minutes a day.

24:12.680 --> 24:14.300
Just get as much light in your eyes,

24:14.300 --> 24:16.260
ideally from sunlight throughout the day,

24:16.260 --> 24:17.740
as is safe for you,

24:17.740 --> 24:19.260
meaning where you're not getting sunburned

24:19.260 --> 24:20.820
and you're not damaging your retina.

24:20.820 --> 24:23.120
And if you want to know if you're damaging your retina,

24:23.120 --> 24:25.820
well, anytime you have to blink or turn away from light

24:25.820 --> 24:26.860
because it's really bright,

24:26.860 --> 24:28.900
that's a signal that the light is too bright.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.580
So while you want to place yourself into bright environments,

24:31.580 --> 24:33.620
you don't want to place yourself into any environment

24:33.620 --> 24:35.620
so bright that it's painful to be in.

24:35.620 --> 24:38.460
Okay, so use that as a metric and you should be just fine.

24:38.460 --> 24:41.060
And the last point about light for mood and mental health

24:41.060 --> 24:42.900
is a relatively recent theme

24:42.900 --> 24:44.860
that's emerging from the scientific literature

24:44.860 --> 24:47.660
and that really was driven home by a recent study

24:47.660 --> 24:49.260
that I mentioned a little bit earlier in the episode.

24:49.260 --> 24:51.540
This is the study published in Nature Mental Health,

24:51.540 --> 24:54.900
showing that darkness during a particular stage

24:54.900 --> 24:56.460
of your 24 hour cycle,

24:56.460 --> 24:58.260
your so-called circadian rhythm,

24:58.260 --> 25:02.300
is also very beneficial for mood and mental health.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.720
And it's beneficial for mood and mental health

25:04.720 --> 25:09.060
in a way that is independent from light and from sleep.

25:09.060 --> 25:10.260
Now, what do I mean by that?

25:10.260 --> 25:11.940
Okay, well, there are a number of different ways

25:11.940 --> 25:13.180
that this can be examined,

25:13.180 --> 25:16.980
but in this particular study, which I like oh so much,

25:16.980 --> 25:19.580
entitled Day and Night Light Exposure

25:19.580 --> 25:21.980
are Associated with Psychiatric Disorders,

25:21.980 --> 25:25.900
an objective light study in more than 85,000 people.

25:25.900 --> 25:30.060
What the researchers did is they analyzed how much light

25:30.060 --> 25:33.780
and or dark people were getting across the 24 hour cycle

25:33.780 --> 25:36.860
and correlated that with mental health outcomes,

25:36.860 --> 25:39.220
looking at a range of different mental health challenges,

25:39.220 --> 25:41.900
including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, depression,

25:41.900 --> 25:43.820
PTSD, and much more.

25:43.820 --> 25:46.300
And I'll go into this study in a lot of detail

25:46.300 --> 25:47.220
in a future episode,

25:47.220 --> 25:48.580
cause it's such an important study

25:48.580 --> 25:51.180
with so many gems within it that we should all know about.

25:51.180 --> 25:53.680
But one of the key things from this study

25:53.680 --> 25:58.180
is that the positive effects of daytime sunlight exposure

25:58.180 --> 26:02.340
and the positive effects of nighttime dark exposure,

26:02.340 --> 26:04.940
that means of course the absence of light,

26:04.940 --> 26:07.300
are independent of one another.

26:07.300 --> 26:10.980
Put differently, making sure that you're in very dim

26:10.980 --> 26:13.640
to completely dark environments

26:13.640 --> 26:16.760
for a continuous six to eight hours

26:16.760 --> 26:19.620
within every 24 hours circadian cycle

26:19.620 --> 26:23.040
is correlated with much better mental health outcomes.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.720
In other words, we shouldn't just think about

26:25.720 --> 26:28.080
the presence of light in the morning

26:28.080 --> 26:30.040
and throughout the day as positive for mental health.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.160
That's all true, it's absolutely true.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.800
And this study further verifies that,

26:33.800 --> 26:35.280
but that's been known for some time,

26:35.280 --> 26:38.200
indeed decades from the scientific research.

26:38.200 --> 26:40.420
And of course it's been known for thousands of years

26:40.420 --> 26:42.080
intuitively and subjectively

26:42.080 --> 26:45.380
without detailed scientific measurement.

26:45.380 --> 26:46.880
But in addition to that,

26:46.880 --> 26:51.160
this study shows that people who stay in very dim

26:51.160 --> 26:55.560
to dark environments for eight hours every 24 hours,

26:55.560 --> 26:57.920
or I should say approximately eight hours

26:57.920 --> 26:59.900
in every 24 hour cycle,

26:59.900 --> 27:03.080
they benefit from improved mood and mental health outcomes

27:03.080 --> 27:05.740
in a way that's independent of how much light they're getting

27:05.740 --> 27:09.300
and independent of how much sleep they are getting.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.320
The point is this, the time when you wake up,

27:11.320 --> 27:13.160
consider that time zero.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.720
And then about, again,

27:14.720 --> 27:16.500
you don't have to be super strict about this,

27:16.500 --> 27:20.720
about 16 to 24 hours after that wake up time,

27:20.720 --> 27:23.340
you should be in a very dim to dark environment

27:23.340 --> 27:28.340
for that 16 hour to 24 hour period after waking up, okay?

27:28.640 --> 27:29.760
What do I mean by this?

27:29.760 --> 27:31.940
I mean, if you go to sleep at 10 PM

27:31.940 --> 27:34.120
and you wake up at 6 AM,

27:34.120 --> 27:37.460
well that 10 PM to 6 AM phase of your circadian cycle,

27:37.460 --> 27:39.280
you should be in very dim light

27:39.280 --> 27:42.180
or entirely dark environment.

27:42.180 --> 27:44.320
This is a great opportunity to reference another study

27:44.320 --> 27:46.120
which was published in the proceedings

27:46.120 --> 27:47.440
of the National Academy of Sciences,

27:47.440 --> 27:49.840
which shows that even having a small amount

27:49.840 --> 27:52.920
of light in the room, which isn't even that bright,

27:52.920 --> 27:55.000
while you're sleeping with eyes closed

27:55.000 --> 27:57.800
can disrupt morning glucose levels.

27:57.800 --> 28:01.520
So in other words, keep your sleeping environment dark,

28:01.520 --> 28:03.440
keep your nighttime environment dim

28:03.440 --> 28:05.960
to the best of your abilities, right?

28:05.960 --> 28:07.960
Certainly go out to dinner every once in a while,

28:07.960 --> 28:10.780
go to the movies, go out and have a party, enjoy yourself.

28:10.780 --> 28:12.520
If you have to go to the hospital, God forbid,

28:12.520 --> 28:15.040
or you have to tend to some emergency, do that.

28:15.040 --> 28:17.200
But to the extent that you can control it

28:17.200 --> 28:20.360
within the confines of life and its demands,

28:20.360 --> 28:23.760
keep your nighttime environment dim or dark

28:23.760 --> 28:26.320
because that independently of any sunlight

28:26.320 --> 28:27.680
and other bright light that you're viewing

28:27.680 --> 28:29.500
during the daytime and afternoon

28:29.500 --> 28:33.460
is going to positively improve your mood and mental health.

28:33.460 --> 28:34.920
Now moving on to the other pillars

28:34.920 --> 28:37.280
and these I'm going to move through a bit more quickly

28:37.280 --> 28:38.440
than I have the previous two

28:38.440 --> 28:40.940
because we've done entire series on these,

28:40.940 --> 28:43.480
or I should say seriesies, seriesies?

28:43.480 --> 28:44.320
Is that how you pronounce it?

28:44.320 --> 28:46.160
Someone put the plural of seriesies

28:46.160 --> 28:49.440
in the comments on YouTube.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.920
The third pillar is movement.

28:50.920 --> 28:53.320
And when I say movement, I mean exercise.

28:53.320 --> 28:56.460
As you all know, we should all strive to get anywhere

28:56.460 --> 29:01.060
from 180 to 220 minutes of zone two cardio per week.

29:01.060 --> 29:04.520
That's movement that allows you to hold a conversation,

29:04.520 --> 29:07.200
but were you to do it more intensely,

29:07.200 --> 29:08.400
or even a bit more intensely,

29:08.400 --> 29:10.080
you wouldn't be able to hold that conversation.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.280
In addition, we should do some VO2 max work.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.200
We should get our heart rate very high

29:14.200 --> 29:15.320
at least once a week,

29:15.320 --> 29:16.920
doing some sort of movement that's safe for you.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.160
So that could be running or cycling or swimming

29:19.160 --> 29:20.960
or Pilates, whatever it is for you,

29:20.960 --> 29:24.280
getting your heart rate way, way up is also important.

29:24.280 --> 29:25.880
And to do that at least once a week,

29:25.880 --> 29:28.400
but daily movement, either cardiovascular training

29:28.400 --> 29:29.520
or resistance training.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.840
And it's very, very clear that we need both,

29:31.840 --> 29:33.180
maybe not on the same days.

29:33.180 --> 29:35.360
In fact, I split them to separate days.

29:35.360 --> 29:39.200
Resistance training done for anywhere from six to 10 sets

29:39.200 --> 29:42.280
per muscle group, either close to or to failure.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.080
This could be with weights, it could be with bands,

29:44.080 --> 29:45.360
it could be with machines.

29:45.360 --> 29:48.800
All of that was covered in detail in the podcast series

29:48.800 --> 29:51.880
that I did with Dr. Andy Galpin, an exercise physiologist

29:51.880 --> 29:53.180
who's expert in all those areas.

29:53.180 --> 29:56.900
I also did an episode on a foundational fitness protocol

29:56.900 --> 30:01.360
that has been distilled into a very simple three page PDF

30:01.360 --> 30:03.440
that you can get for completely zero cost

30:03.440 --> 30:05.000
by going to hubermanlab.com

30:05.000 --> 30:07.120
and just put foundational fitness protocol PDF

30:07.120 --> 30:08.600
and you'll be taken to that toolkit.

30:08.600 --> 30:11.960
So all of the details of a weekly exercise routine

30:11.960 --> 30:15.800
that involves daily movement, but also certainly in my case

30:15.800 --> 30:18.560
includes at least one full day of rest per week,

30:18.560 --> 30:20.580
because many people do indeed need one,

30:20.580 --> 30:23.040
maybe even two full days of rest per week.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.280
So that highlights the third pillar movement,

30:25.280 --> 30:27.480
but we know that cardiovascular training

30:27.480 --> 30:29.840
and resistance training aren't just great for our body.

30:29.840 --> 30:32.600
They also improve mood and mental health.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.400
That's so very clear from the research literature.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.280
So we can't overlook those in a conversation

30:38.280 --> 30:39.860
about mood and mental health.

30:39.860 --> 30:42.040
Now the fourth pillar is nutrition.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.560
And nutrition is a big topic.

30:43.560 --> 30:44.960
It's a very barbed wire topic.

30:44.960 --> 30:47.240
If you get involved in this stuff online,

30:47.240 --> 30:49.840
you know, you've got your people who believe that,

30:49.840 --> 30:51.600
you know, carnivore is better than vegan.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.760
You have the people who believe vegan

30:52.760 --> 30:53.680
is better than carnivore.

30:53.680 --> 30:54.880
Most people are omnivores.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.320
You have your seed oil debates and on and on and on.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.240
We're not going to touch any of that now.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.200
Indeed, if you want to learn more about nutrition

31:02.200 --> 31:03.800
and what works and what doesn't work

31:03.800 --> 31:05.960
for sake of aesthetic changes, weight loss,

31:05.960 --> 31:06.880
muscle gain, et cetera,

31:06.880 --> 31:09.280
I would refer you to the guest episode

31:09.280 --> 31:11.360
that we did with Dr. Lane Norton.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.160
You can find that again at hubermanlab.com

31:13.160 --> 31:15.320
where we do a deep dive on all the variations

31:15.320 --> 31:17.480
and different nutritional protocols.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.300
But suffice to say that regardless of whether or not

31:20.300 --> 31:23.100
you're vegan, omnivore, carnivore, or keto or whatever,

31:24.060 --> 31:26.640
everybody needs to consume sufficient amounts,

31:26.640 --> 31:30.380
but not excess amounts of quality calories per day.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.040
Now you may do that by intermittent fasting.

31:32.040 --> 31:34.720
You may do that by a more traditional meal scheduling,

31:34.720 --> 31:37.880
but everybody's going to need to do that

31:37.880 --> 31:39.680
because your body and brain,

31:39.680 --> 31:42.360
and indeed the parts of your body and brain

31:42.360 --> 31:45.760
that translate to mood and mental health

31:45.760 --> 31:47.840
require macronutrients,

31:47.840 --> 31:49.200
proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,

31:49.200 --> 31:50.480
as well as micronutrients.

31:50.480 --> 31:52.420
So the key takeaway with nutrition

31:52.420 --> 31:54.400
is to make it quality nutrition

31:54.400 --> 31:57.160
within the bounds of whatever sort of nutritional program

31:57.160 --> 31:58.040
that you're following.

31:58.040 --> 32:01.880
And that means getting most of your food sources

32:01.880 --> 32:05.280
from either non-processed or minimally processed foods.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.520
So these will be foods that you're going to need to prepare

32:07.520 --> 32:10.720
or foods that would perish over time.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.600
These are not the sorts of foods that live in boxes

32:12.600 --> 32:14.360
and cans and other packages

32:14.360 --> 32:15.800
that would allow them to live on the shelves

32:15.800 --> 32:17.120
forever and ever.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.520
Okay, and as I say that, I know many people are shouting,

32:19.520 --> 32:20.880
well, what about rice?

32:20.880 --> 32:22.540
Rice can live on the shelf for a long time.

32:22.540 --> 32:26.520
And yes, okay, I consider rice a minimally processed food

32:26.520 --> 32:28.080
because of course it can live on the shelf

32:28.080 --> 32:29.000
for a long period of time.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.560
And here I'm just going to back out of the whole conversation

32:31.560 --> 32:32.800
about nutrition at this point,

32:32.800 --> 32:35.160
because as you can probably tell,

32:35.160 --> 32:38.800
it's a deep series of rabbit holes that we can fall into

32:38.800 --> 32:39.760
and really get distracted.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.280
The point is make sure you're getting enough food.

32:42.280 --> 32:43.240
Don't overeat.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.320
We know energy toxicity is a problem

32:46.320 --> 32:49.120
for not just body composition, but for mental health.

32:49.120 --> 32:52.520
So you want to get enough calories, but not too few calories.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.160
And you'll want to make sure that you're getting them

32:54.160 --> 32:55.640
from quality sources.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.840
And I say that because of course,

32:56.840 --> 33:00.000
food is not just the substrate for the seller repair

33:00.000 --> 33:02.740
and indeed production of tissues in your body,

33:02.740 --> 33:05.260
but it's also the substrate for all the sorts

33:05.260 --> 33:06.920
of neurotransmitters, right?

33:06.920 --> 33:09.040
Which are derived from amino acid precursors

33:09.040 --> 33:11.080
that are derived from food, right?

33:11.080 --> 33:13.560
All of that dopamine stuff and serotonin stuff

33:13.560 --> 33:16.160
is derived from amino acids that come from food sources.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.900
So the link between nutrition and mental health

33:18.900 --> 33:20.480
should now be an obvious one.

33:20.480 --> 33:23.040
As we all know, quality nutrition influences,

33:23.040 --> 33:24.200
of course, our physical health,

33:24.200 --> 33:26.920
but also our mental health and our cognitive functioning,

33:26.920 --> 33:29.840
our memory, our ability to learn new things and to focus.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.020
And we know that one of the most important features

33:32.020 --> 33:33.960
of high quality nutrition is making sure

33:33.960 --> 33:35.960
that we get enough vitamins and minerals

33:35.960 --> 33:39.560
from high quality, unprocessed or minimally processed sources,

33:39.560 --> 33:42.680
as well as enough probiotics and prebiotics and fiber

33:42.680 --> 33:45.740
to support basically all the cellular functions in our body,

33:45.740 --> 33:47.600
including the gut microbiome.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.720
Now, I, like most everybody,

33:49.720 --> 33:52.780
try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods,

33:52.780 --> 33:56.960
ideally mostly from minimally processed or non-processed foods.

33:56.960 --> 33:58.440
However, one of the challenges that I

33:58.440 --> 33:59.920
and so many other people face

33:59.920 --> 34:02.000
is getting enough servings of high quality fruits

34:02.000 --> 34:04.940
and vegetables per day, as well as fiber and probiotics

34:04.940 --> 34:07.140
that often accompany those fruits and vegetables.

34:07.140 --> 34:09.180
That's why way back in 2012,

34:09.180 --> 34:13.040
long before I ever had a podcast, I started drinking AG1.

34:13.040 --> 34:14.620
And so I'm delighted that AG1

34:14.620 --> 34:16.780
is sponsoring the Huberman Lab podcast.

34:16.780 --> 34:18.520
The reason I started taking AG1

34:18.520 --> 34:21.800
and the reason I still drink AG1 once or twice a day

34:21.800 --> 34:24.600
is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.560
That is, it provides insurance

34:26.560 --> 34:28.920
that I get the proper amounts of those vitamins,

34:28.920 --> 34:30.960
minerals, probiotics, and fiber

34:30.960 --> 34:33.000
to ensure optimal mental health,

34:33.000 --> 34:35.200
physical health, and performance.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.600
If you'd like to try AG1,

34:36.600 --> 34:39.880
you can go to drinkag1.com slash Huberman

34:39.880 --> 34:41.440
to claim a special offer.

34:41.440 --> 34:43.200
They're giving away five free travel packs

34:43.200 --> 34:46.040
plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.360
Again, that's drinkag1.com slash Huberman

34:49.360 --> 34:51.240
to claim that special offer.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.760
The fifth pillar in the big six is social connection.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.120
And we're going to talk a little bit more

34:55.120 --> 34:56.740
about this later in the episode,

34:56.740 --> 34:59.320
but let's just be very brief and specific about this.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.580
We all need to strive to limit the number

35:02.580 --> 35:06.280
of social interactions that we feel tax

35:06.280 --> 35:09.000
or even vex us that cause us stress.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.720
This is something that was covered in depth

35:11.720 --> 35:13.540
in the episode with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

35:13.540 --> 35:15.080
where she talked about the fact

35:15.080 --> 35:16.700
that we don't just have a nervous system

35:16.700 --> 35:19.080
that regulates itself through experience

35:19.080 --> 35:21.760
and through our thoughts and our actions.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.400
We are, as a species, interacting with other nervous systems,

35:25.400 --> 35:27.760
both of our own species, other humans,

35:27.760 --> 35:30.240
as well as non-human species, dogs and cats,

35:30.240 --> 35:32.600
and if you have them, horses and other animals.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.240
So we need to think about our nervous system

35:34.240 --> 35:36.320
as being both regulated from the inside

35:36.320 --> 35:38.760
and through our own actions and choices and thoughts,

35:38.760 --> 35:41.800
but also through interaction with other nervous systems.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.200
And while we don't always have as much control

35:44.200 --> 35:47.600
over which social interactions or work interactions

35:47.600 --> 35:49.280
we have to engage in,

35:49.280 --> 35:52.080
we should really strive to understand

35:52.080 --> 35:54.260
and indeed pay some serious attention

35:54.260 --> 35:57.400
to whether or not certain types of social interactions

35:57.400 --> 36:01.420
are what she referred to as net savings,

36:01.420 --> 36:04.040
neutral or taxing, right?

36:04.040 --> 36:05.680
Certain types of social interactions

36:05.680 --> 36:07.480
with certain people or groups of people

36:07.480 --> 36:08.760
just make us feel taxed.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.520
It makes us feel stressed.

36:10.520 --> 36:13.600
It leads to negative affect.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.720
That is not good feelings or emotions

36:16.720 --> 36:19.520
and often elevated levels of autonomic arousal

36:19.520 --> 36:20.800
that leave us ruminating

36:20.800 --> 36:22.480
and leave us having challenges with sleep.

36:22.480 --> 36:25.680
We really should all strive to limit those interactions

36:25.680 --> 36:27.280
to the extent that we can.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.520
On the reverse side of that,

36:28.520 --> 36:31.760
as Lisa Feldman Barrett so beautifully pointed out,

36:31.760 --> 36:32.980
we also have the capability

36:32.980 --> 36:34.820
to regulate each other's nervous systems

36:34.820 --> 36:37.080
in ways that produce savings,

36:37.080 --> 36:39.400
that is, that allow us to feel

36:39.400 --> 36:42.040
and indeed cause physiological changes

36:42.040 --> 36:45.360
that make us feel not just happier, not just relaxed,

36:45.360 --> 36:48.840
not just happy because we enjoy interacting with somebody

36:48.840 --> 36:52.500
but we're a group, but that give us a savings,

36:52.500 --> 36:54.360
that give us the kind of resources,

36:54.360 --> 36:56.960
literally metabolic and neurochemical resources

36:56.960 --> 36:58.640
that make us feel more capable

36:58.640 --> 37:00.480
and give us a sense of elevated mood

37:00.480 --> 37:01.580
and improved mental health

37:01.580 --> 37:04.000
when we are not engaging with those people.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.760
And this is highly subjective, of course,

37:05.760 --> 37:07.240
but you should be able to distinguish.

37:07.240 --> 37:09.880
In fact, I encourage you to spend a little bit of time,

37:09.880 --> 37:11.520
maybe even just five or 10 minutes,

37:11.520 --> 37:14.160
thinking about who are the individuals and groups

37:14.160 --> 37:17.840
that I interact with that leave me feeling taxed,

37:17.840 --> 37:20.080
that really seem to drain my energy

37:20.080 --> 37:23.040
and have me ruminating and in a not good space

37:23.040 --> 37:25.400
when I leave whatever interaction I had with them.

37:25.400 --> 37:28.160
This could be a real interaction or an online interaction.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.680
Indeed, I did this the other day based on Lisa's suggestion.

37:30.680 --> 37:33.040
I found it to be tremendously useful.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.640
What I did is I decided to,

37:35.640 --> 37:37.400
and by the way, this was happening on a run

37:37.400 --> 37:38.620
where I was thinking,

37:38.620 --> 37:41.600
a lot of my mind is in a conversation with people

37:41.600 --> 37:42.640
that aren't even here.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.600
I was sort of working through a conversation.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.080
I was thinking about what I would say,

37:47.080 --> 37:49.280
what I did say, what they said,

37:49.280 --> 37:52.480
in an interaction that unfortunately was pretty unpleasant.

37:52.480 --> 37:53.800
It wasn't extremely unpleasant,

37:53.800 --> 37:54.800
but it was pretty unpleasant.

37:54.800 --> 37:58.040
And I realized, okay, that is a sort of interaction

37:58.040 --> 37:59.560
that I would like to avoid in the future

37:59.560 --> 38:01.380
because it wasn't happening right then,

38:01.380 --> 38:04.420
but it was carried forward into a portion of my day,

38:04.420 --> 38:07.880
my morning run that for me is normally very pleasurable

38:07.880 --> 38:10.040
and quite sacred to me, actually.

38:10.040 --> 38:11.520
So paying some attention

38:11.520 --> 38:13.960
to how much of your internal dialogue is with yourself

38:13.960 --> 38:16.160
versus with others and how much of that is positive

38:16.160 --> 38:18.440
or negative is extremely beneficial.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.920
And I'm not talking about always just thinking about oneself

38:20.920 --> 38:22.040
and not thinking about others.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.500
To the contrary, we also need to think,

38:24.500 --> 38:26.600
as Lisa pointed out,

38:26.600 --> 38:29.940
about who are the people with whom we interact with

38:29.940 --> 38:34.400
or observe that lead us to have ongoing dialogue with them

38:34.400 --> 38:36.520
in our mind or think about those interactions

38:36.520 --> 38:38.200
in ways that give us energy,

38:38.200 --> 38:40.220
that lead to energetic savings,

38:40.220 --> 38:42.540
literally metabolic savings that we can apply,

38:42.540 --> 38:44.580
not just in those interactions,

38:44.580 --> 38:47.620
but in our work endeavors and our solo endeavors,

38:47.620 --> 38:48.460
whatever that we're doing

38:48.460 --> 38:49.880
when we are away from those people.

38:49.880 --> 38:54.880
So while this concept of savings or neutral or taxation

38:56.200 --> 38:58.940
of our metabolic and our neurochemical systems

38:58.940 --> 39:01.380
might seem a little bit squishy, it is not squishy.

39:01.380 --> 39:03.900
This is a neurobiological concept.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.620
It's also a psychological concept.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.760
And it's one that I'm so glad that Lisa brought up

39:07.760 --> 39:11.800
because social connection, social interaction is so vital

39:11.800 --> 39:13.400
to our mood and mental health.

39:13.400 --> 39:15.880
But oftentimes we hear social connection and we think,

39:15.880 --> 39:17.840
oh, that means we have to spend a lot of time with friends.

39:17.840 --> 39:19.560
We have to organize dinner parties.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.680
Well, sure, that's all fine and good if you can do that.

39:22.680 --> 39:24.720
And I do, of course, encourage people to spend time

39:24.720 --> 39:25.680
with those that they love,

39:25.680 --> 39:28.580
but it's also important to take a step back

39:28.580 --> 39:31.240
and just think a bit, maybe even write out a bit,

39:31.240 --> 39:33.400
who are the groups and sorts of individuals

39:33.400 --> 39:34.760
and interactions that really tax you?

39:34.760 --> 39:36.880
Who are the people that you find kind of neutral?

39:36.880 --> 39:38.440
And what are the individuals and groups

39:38.440 --> 39:41.360
that really provide what Lisa referred to as savings?

39:41.360 --> 39:43.200
That is, they tap into the metabolic

39:43.200 --> 39:44.880
and neurochemical pathways that lead us

39:44.880 --> 39:46.840
to have improved mood and mental health,

39:46.840 --> 39:48.580
not just during those interactions,

39:48.580 --> 39:50.820
but away from those interactions as well,

39:50.820 --> 39:54.440
and often pervasively and extremely positively so.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.020
So this is no small deal.

39:57.020 --> 40:00.220
This is a really important aspect of our mental health.

40:00.220 --> 40:04.540
Now, the sixth pillar in the big six is stress control.

40:04.540 --> 40:07.340
And the reason it's included is that,

40:07.340 --> 40:09.780
look, stress is going to happen.

40:09.780 --> 40:12.860
Life is filled with so-called stressors.

40:12.860 --> 40:15.780
And for a good number of years, in fact, the last 15 years,

40:15.780 --> 40:18.380
there's been a lot of debate in the field of psychology

40:18.380 --> 40:19.340
and neuroscience as well,

40:19.340 --> 40:21.140
whether or not stress is good for us,

40:21.140 --> 40:22.420
whether or not stress is bad for us,

40:22.420 --> 40:24.340
whether or not we simply need to reframe stress

40:24.340 --> 40:25.180
as good or bad.

40:25.180 --> 40:27.420
And to some extent, all of that is true.

40:27.420 --> 40:29.780
We know that chronic stress is not good for our memory,

40:29.780 --> 40:31.580
our immune system, or our health.

40:31.580 --> 40:34.700
We also know that if you understand the reality,

40:34.700 --> 40:37.620
which is that stress also allows us to harness our mental

40:37.620 --> 40:40.700
and physical resources to perform better than we would

40:40.700 --> 40:42.580
otherwise in certain circumstances,

40:42.580 --> 40:45.220
and that provided we can get to sleep each night,

40:45.220 --> 40:46.940
that perhaps stress isn't so bad,

40:46.940 --> 40:49.180
and perhaps is even performance enhancing.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.700
I talked about this in the guest episode

40:51.700 --> 40:55.380
with Dr. Ali Krum from the psychology department at Stanford,

40:55.380 --> 40:57.940
and I've talked about this in other podcasts as well.

40:57.940 --> 41:01.060
And I'm not here to tell you that stress is good for you.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.740
I'm not here to tell you that stress is bad for you.

41:02.740 --> 41:05.340
What I am going to tell you is that it is extremely important

41:05.340 --> 41:09.460
that we all have readily accessible stress management tools

41:09.460 --> 41:11.380
that work the first time and every time.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.860
And these fall into two categories.

41:12.860 --> 41:15.140
The first category are real time tools.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.740
So tools that you can use to reduce your level of stress

41:17.740 --> 41:18.700
in real time.

41:18.700 --> 41:21.780
And the best way that I'm aware of that's grounded

41:21.780 --> 41:24.900
in excellent physiology and neuroscience

41:24.900 --> 41:26.820
to reduce your stress in real time

41:26.820 --> 41:28.740
is the so-called physiological side.

41:28.740 --> 41:30.700
I did not invent this pattern of breathing.

41:30.700 --> 41:32.660
It's not breath work per se.

41:32.660 --> 41:34.740
This is a pattern of breathing that we all naturally do

41:34.740 --> 41:37.700
in our sleep to restore carbon dioxide and oxygen levels

41:37.700 --> 41:39.220
to their proper ratios.

41:39.220 --> 41:40.940
We also do it periodically throughout the day

41:40.940 --> 41:41.900
without noticing.

41:41.900 --> 41:45.260
Indeed, we have a defined or specific neural circuit

41:45.260 --> 41:47.420
in our brain that extends to our diaphragm

41:47.420 --> 41:51.380
and communicates with aspects of our heart, et cetera,

41:51.380 --> 41:55.380
that allow physiological size to calm us down faster,

41:55.380 --> 41:58.820
at least to my knowledge, than any other directed protocol.

41:58.820 --> 42:00.860
And the physiological side, as many of you know,

42:00.860 --> 42:02.700
is very simple and straightforward.

42:02.700 --> 42:04.060
Anyone can do this.

42:04.060 --> 42:07.020
You simply do a big inhale through your nose,

42:07.020 --> 42:09.620
try and maximize the inflation of your lungs.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.580
And then before you exhale,

42:11.580 --> 42:13.660
sneak in another brief inhalation,

42:13.660 --> 42:15.620
even if it's just a tiny micro inhalation

42:15.620 --> 42:18.060
to maximally inflate the lungs.

42:18.060 --> 42:20.340
And that has an important effect on the little sacs

42:20.340 --> 42:22.420
in the lungs called the avioli of the lungs.

42:22.420 --> 42:25.340
It's going to open up whatever avioli were collapsed

42:25.340 --> 42:26.180
in there.

42:26.180 --> 42:29.260
And then you're going to do a long extended exhale

42:29.260 --> 42:30.500
through the mouth.

42:30.500 --> 42:32.300
And typically just one,

42:32.300 --> 42:33.900
although sometimes it requires two or three,

42:33.900 --> 42:37.540
but just one physiological sigh is effective

42:37.540 --> 42:40.100
in bringing down one's level of stress

42:40.100 --> 42:42.860
significantly enough that you don't need to do it again.

42:42.860 --> 42:45.500
So this can be done essentially anywhere and by anyone.

42:45.500 --> 42:48.060
I suppose you probably couldn't do it if you were underwater

42:48.060 --> 42:50.580
or certainly don't do it if you're underwater,

42:50.580 --> 42:53.540
but otherwise it's a very safe and very effective way

42:53.540 --> 42:55.740
to calm down and reduce your levels of stress

42:55.740 --> 42:57.940
in real time, maybe before public speaking

42:57.940 --> 43:00.340
or in whatever circumstance you feel you need to calm down

43:00.340 --> 43:01.580
in real time.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.940
So I'll demonstrate the physiological sigh for you here.

43:03.940 --> 43:06.780
I've done this many times before in previous episodes,

43:06.780 --> 43:08.180
but for those of you that haven't heard

43:08.180 --> 43:09.580
or seen those episodes,

43:09.580 --> 43:12.220
I feel obligated to do it again now.

43:12.220 --> 43:13.980
Okay, so it's a deep inhale through the nose

43:13.980 --> 43:15.740
followed by another brief inhale through the nose

43:15.740 --> 43:17.300
and then a long exhale through the mouth.

43:17.300 --> 43:19.100
And before you start asking questions about,

43:19.100 --> 43:20.700
what do I do if I have a deviated septum?

43:20.700 --> 43:22.060
Can it be just through the mouth?

43:22.060 --> 43:23.940
Do the first two through the nose,

43:23.940 --> 43:25.740
do the third through the mouth.

43:25.740 --> 43:26.700
So it's like this.

43:37.140 --> 43:38.860
And indeed I feel calmer.

43:38.860 --> 43:41.420
And indeed, if you do it, you will feel calmer.

43:41.420 --> 43:43.220
You'll notice that second inhale through the nose

43:43.220 --> 43:47.060
was kind of sharp in the sense that I had to really push,

43:47.060 --> 43:49.100
put some physical effort into making it happen.

43:49.100 --> 43:51.180
And my shoulders jolted upwards

43:51.180 --> 43:52.740
if you're just listening to this

43:52.740 --> 43:54.700
and not watching my shoulders jolted upwards.

43:54.700 --> 43:57.380
That second inhale through the nose is important

43:57.380 --> 43:59.460
for a variety of reasons I've talked about elsewhere.

43:59.460 --> 44:01.900
So the physiological sigh is going to be

44:01.900 --> 44:03.620
the go-to protocol for you.

44:03.620 --> 44:05.060
Again, not invented by me.

44:05.060 --> 44:06.300
This is not Huberman breathing.

44:06.300 --> 44:09.660
This is a pattern of breathing discovered in the 1930s

44:09.660 --> 44:10.620
by physiologists.

44:10.620 --> 44:12.420
It's hardwired into our nervous system.

44:12.420 --> 44:13.580
And that's what makes it so great.

44:13.580 --> 44:16.380
It works the first time and it works every time.

44:16.380 --> 44:17.860
So that's, to my knowledge,

44:17.860 --> 44:21.580
the best way to control your stress in real time.

44:21.580 --> 44:24.300
Now, why is that important for mood and mental health?

44:24.300 --> 44:26.580
Well, as we'll talk about later,

44:26.580 --> 44:29.300
if you want to access your so-called generative drive,

44:29.300 --> 44:31.580
a theme that we're going to get into in a bit more detail,

44:31.580 --> 44:33.580
this is something that came up during the series

44:33.580 --> 44:35.020
with Dr. Paul Conti,

44:35.020 --> 44:38.180
you will learn that stress and anger and negative emotions,

44:38.180 --> 44:41.100
while they can be very motivating, very arousing,

44:41.100 --> 44:43.580
they are not going to be good

44:43.580 --> 44:47.500
for your long-term mood and mental health, period.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.980
So having tools to regulate your stress

44:49.980 --> 44:52.460
and your levels of anger, your levels of reactivity,

44:52.460 --> 44:54.860
and also to elevate your feelings of agency

44:54.860 --> 44:56.100
and control over your life,

44:56.100 --> 44:59.500
starting with agency and control over your physiology,

44:59.500 --> 45:02.420
your internal state, is going to be vital.

45:02.420 --> 45:04.300
And what I love about the physiological side

45:04.300 --> 45:06.380
is that, of course, it's completely zero cost,

45:06.380 --> 45:10.060
but also there's a dedicated circuit in your brain and body

45:10.060 --> 45:12.500
for this particular pattern of breathing.

45:12.500 --> 45:15.820
We do it spontaneously, but you can do it intentionally

45:15.820 --> 45:18.100
and it works just as well, if not better,

45:18.100 --> 45:19.780
to regulate your levels of stress.

45:19.780 --> 45:21.580
That is to bring them down,

45:21.580 --> 45:23.740
which has outsized positive effects

45:23.740 --> 45:25.820
on your mood and mental health, not just in the moment,

45:25.820 --> 45:28.860
but it also should improve your confidence

45:28.860 --> 45:31.060
that when stress comes,

45:31.060 --> 45:33.300
because the world is filled with stressors, it's not if,

45:33.300 --> 45:34.940
it's when, when stress comes

45:34.940 --> 45:37.020
that you will have a physiologically,

45:37.020 --> 45:39.420
scientifically supported tool to deal with

45:39.420 --> 45:41.060
and reduce that stress.

45:41.060 --> 45:42.940
Now, in addition, I do believe it's important

45:42.940 --> 45:44.900
for sake of mood and mental health

45:44.900 --> 45:48.420
to also have a tool or a protocol

45:48.420 --> 45:50.500
to raise your stress threshold.

45:50.500 --> 45:52.220
That is to increase your capacity

45:52.220 --> 45:53.660
to deal with life stressors

45:53.660 --> 45:56.260
without them feeling so stressful.

45:56.260 --> 45:57.700
And there are a number of different ways to do this,

45:57.700 --> 46:00.140
but they all center around elevating your levels

46:00.140 --> 46:03.660
of adrenaline, epinephrine, and norepinephrine,

46:03.660 --> 46:05.420
noradrenaline, those are the same thing,

46:05.420 --> 46:07.100
just they have multiple names, forgive me.

46:07.100 --> 46:08.900
I didn't give the same two things four names,

46:08.900 --> 46:12.380
so don't blame me, blame the other scientists that did it.

46:12.380 --> 46:15.220
The point is, there are several ways

46:15.220 --> 46:17.780
that you can self-induce elevations

46:17.780 --> 46:21.220
of noradrenaline and adrenaline,

46:21.220 --> 46:24.180
and then to learn to anchor your mind

46:24.180 --> 46:25.620
and your thinking to stay calm

46:25.620 --> 46:27.540
in those elevated adrenaline states

46:27.540 --> 46:30.140
as a practice for when stressors hit you

46:30.140 --> 46:31.300
in the outside world

46:31.300 --> 46:33.940
and your adrenaline and noradrenaline spike.

46:33.940 --> 46:36.700
Now, one of the best ways to do this,

46:36.700 --> 46:38.940
because it works the first time and every time

46:38.940 --> 46:42.500
and is also zero cost, in fact, it will save you money,

46:42.500 --> 46:45.660
is to put yourself in a cold shower

46:45.660 --> 46:48.460
or other deliberate cold exposure environment,

46:48.460 --> 46:51.300
but most everyone has access to a cold shower,

46:51.300 --> 46:53.060
not everyone, but most people.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.820
And of course, by turning off the heat,

46:54.820 --> 46:57.740
you're going to reduce heating costs, right, your water bill.

46:57.740 --> 47:01.780
So getting into a cold shower for a minute or so

47:01.780 --> 47:03.220
to elevate your levels of adrenaline

47:03.220 --> 47:05.100
and learning to either use your breathing,

47:05.100 --> 47:06.900
you could do physiological size,

47:06.900 --> 47:08.620
or to distract yourself,

47:08.620 --> 47:10.940
or whatever tools and approaches you need

47:10.940 --> 47:13.300
to be able to stay calm

47:13.300 --> 47:16.500
while you have elevated levels of adrenaline in your body.

47:16.500 --> 47:19.020
And the reason deliberate cold exposure works so well

47:19.020 --> 47:22.860
to do this is that it is pretty non-negotiable.

47:22.860 --> 47:25.500
Even if you really love cold showers or cold plunges

47:25.500 --> 47:27.220
or things of that sort,

47:27.220 --> 47:30.060
you're still going to get that elevated adrenaline

47:30.060 --> 47:31.260
and noradrenaline.

47:31.260 --> 47:34.020
It's pretty much non-negotiable.

47:34.020 --> 47:35.340
For the first 10 or 15 seconds

47:35.340 --> 47:37.180
that you get into a cold plunge or a cold shower,

47:37.180 --> 47:39.860
you should fully expect yourself to feel stressed

47:39.860 --> 47:41.420
and for your breathing to accelerate.

47:41.420 --> 47:43.260
And then your goal is to try and anchor

47:43.260 --> 47:45.980
or control your breathing in that stressful environment.

47:45.980 --> 47:48.420
The reason for doing this is that it's a practice.

47:48.420 --> 47:50.420
It's a practice that's going to translate

47:50.420 --> 47:53.260
to a better ability to manage your internal state,

47:53.260 --> 47:55.500
and therefore your thinking, your cognition,

47:55.500 --> 47:58.460
and your ability to make good decisions under stress.

47:58.460 --> 48:02.180
It's not about becoming untouched by stress.

48:02.180 --> 48:05.260
It's about being able to better navigate stress.

48:05.260 --> 48:08.780
Indeed, I think of this as analogous to driving in fog,

48:08.780 --> 48:09.940
something that I had to learn to do

48:09.940 --> 48:11.140
because I grew up in the Bay Area

48:11.140 --> 48:13.340
and it can be very foggy there sometimes.

48:13.340 --> 48:15.340
And of course you don't learn to drive in fog

48:15.340 --> 48:16.700
the first day you learn how to drive,

48:16.700 --> 48:19.220
but the first time you hit heavy fog driving

48:19.220 --> 48:20.740
where you can only see one reflector

48:20.740 --> 48:23.740
in front of you at a time, it is truly stressful, right?

48:23.740 --> 48:24.860
You don't know if you're going to come up

48:24.860 --> 48:27.460
on another vehicle in an instant,

48:27.460 --> 48:28.780
which of course can happen.

48:28.780 --> 48:30.380
So you have to adjust a number of things.

48:30.380 --> 48:31.700
You have to learn how to do that.

48:31.700 --> 48:34.940
And while I would never elect to drive in fog,

48:34.940 --> 48:36.780
learning to drive in fog teaches you

48:36.780 --> 48:38.020
how to be comfortable driving

48:38.020 --> 48:39.100
in different weather environments.

48:39.100 --> 48:40.540
Same thing with driving in a rainstorm

48:40.540 --> 48:42.860
or for you East coasters from the Northeast,

48:42.860 --> 48:44.380
learning how to drive in a snowstorm.

48:44.380 --> 48:45.820
You would never elect to do that,

48:45.820 --> 48:46.980
but once you do it a few times,

48:46.980 --> 48:49.940
you feel more comfortable in those extreme conditions.

48:49.940 --> 48:52.180
So that's really what raising your stress threshold

48:52.180 --> 48:53.060
is all about.

48:53.060 --> 48:55.900
Of course, do it safely, do it under conditions

48:55.900 --> 48:57.020
in which you're not going to get hurt

48:57.020 --> 48:58.780
or anyone else will get hurt.

48:58.780 --> 49:01.060
But learning how to do this can be extremely beneficial.

49:01.060 --> 49:04.220
And of course, deliberate cold exposure isn't the only way,

49:04.220 --> 49:06.220
but frankly, it's the most reliable way

49:06.220 --> 49:08.460
and it's the most versatile way to do that

49:08.460 --> 49:09.780
because you can do it in your shower

49:09.780 --> 49:11.260
or in a cold plunge at home.

49:11.260 --> 49:12.860
So you can practice these things.

49:12.860 --> 49:14.260
Again, safety first,

49:14.260 --> 49:17.260
always make sure you're not exposing yourself to cold

49:17.260 --> 49:18.860
to the extent that you're going to damage yourself

49:18.860 --> 49:21.740
mentally or physically, but it's a great practice.

49:21.740 --> 49:22.940
And you could probably think of other ways

49:22.940 --> 49:25.500
to spike your adrenaline that was safe.

49:25.500 --> 49:28.140
And of course, life will spike your adrenaline.

49:28.140 --> 49:33.140
So you can also use real life as your stress inoculation tool

49:33.380 --> 49:35.100
and we all have to do that anyway.

49:35.100 --> 49:38.220
What I'm suggesting is that you adopt a real time tool,

49:38.220 --> 49:40.340
physiological size, and that you adopt

49:40.340 --> 49:43.220
at least one offline tool that you do anywhere from one

49:43.220 --> 49:45.140
to three, maybe seven days a week,

49:45.140 --> 49:46.820
but at least one day a week that you put yourself

49:46.820 --> 49:49.420
into a cold shower, deliberate cold exposure,

49:49.420 --> 49:51.860
not for sake of increasing metabolism or anything else,

49:51.860 --> 49:54.780
but really just to learn how to calm yourself

49:54.780 --> 49:58.140
and maintain clear cognition when stress hits

49:58.140 --> 50:00.660
because indeed stress is going to hit.

50:00.660 --> 50:04.180
So that's the big six for improving mood and mental health.

50:04.180 --> 50:07.460
And the big six apply, that is they are the cornerstone

50:07.460 --> 50:10.220
for mood and mental health, regardless of who you are,

50:10.220 --> 50:12.700
regardless of your age, regardless of whether or not

50:12.700 --> 50:15.220
you're dealing with an acute or a severe mood

50:15.220 --> 50:17.540
or mental health disorder, or you find yourself

50:17.540 --> 50:19.660
to be reasonably healthy with respect

50:19.660 --> 50:21.100
to mood and mental health.

50:21.100 --> 50:22.980
And you simply want your mood and mental health

50:22.980 --> 50:26.540
to be stable and or improve over time.

50:26.540 --> 50:30.060
Now, the reason why the big six, those six pillars

50:30.060 --> 50:32.220
are so important for mood and mental health

50:32.220 --> 50:34.100
and indeed form a critical component

50:35.020 --> 50:36.420
of what Dr. Paul Conti referred to

50:36.420 --> 50:39.300
as the first principles of self-care

50:39.300 --> 50:43.220
is that those six pillars establish a milieu

50:43.220 --> 50:46.260
that is an environment of neurochemicals,

50:46.260 --> 50:49.260
including neuromodulators such as dopamine, serotonin,

50:49.260 --> 50:51.980
epinephrine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine,

50:51.980 --> 50:55.380
and other neurochemicals as well, as well as hormones,

50:55.380 --> 50:58.460
testosterone, estrogen, prolactin, cortisol,

50:58.460 --> 51:01.820
and immune molecules and on and on

51:01.820 --> 51:05.420
that lead to a high degree of predictability

51:05.420 --> 51:07.300
in your brain and nervous system.

51:07.300 --> 51:08.380
Now, what do I mean by that?

51:08.380 --> 51:11.260
Why would predictability be such a key component

51:11.260 --> 51:12.580
of mood and mental health?

51:12.580 --> 51:14.420
Is it really just about knowing that you're going

51:14.420 --> 51:16.380
to feel energized in the early part of the day

51:16.380 --> 51:18.020
and tired at the end of the day?

51:18.020 --> 51:19.060
Now, that might be part of it,

51:19.060 --> 51:21.300
but that's not the major takeaway.

51:21.300 --> 51:24.620
The major takeaway is that as Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

51:24.620 --> 51:27.180
so aptly pointed out, your brain

51:27.180 --> 51:29.260
and indeed your entire nervous system

51:29.260 --> 51:31.180
has a couple of major jobs,

51:31.180 --> 51:33.020
has the job of regulating your breathing

51:33.020 --> 51:34.980
and your heart rate, et cetera.

51:34.980 --> 51:37.260
It also has the job of regulating your thinking

51:37.260 --> 51:38.940
and your planning and your memory.

51:38.940 --> 51:41.180
Those are the jobs of the brain and nervous system

51:41.180 --> 51:42.780
that we normally hear about.

51:42.780 --> 51:44.900
But if we think about the more macro jobs

51:44.900 --> 51:48.380
that the brain has, the key function of the brain,

51:48.380 --> 51:49.940
certainly the parts of the brain

51:49.940 --> 51:52.020
that are more recently evolved,

51:52.020 --> 51:54.620
the ones involved in thinking and planning, et cetera,

51:54.620 --> 51:57.740
are really involved in generating predictions,

51:57.740 --> 52:00.300
predictions about what's going to happen next

52:00.300 --> 52:02.220
and whether or not you're going to be prepared

52:02.220 --> 52:03.740
for what's going to happen next.

52:03.740 --> 52:06.060
And indeed, Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett

52:06.060 --> 52:08.420
also beautifully illustrated this model

52:08.420 --> 52:12.340
of the brain as regulating a brain-body budget

52:12.340 --> 52:16.980
and moods and a related topic, which she called affect.

52:16.980 --> 52:19.300
Okay, I'll explain what affect is in a moment.

52:19.300 --> 52:23.060
Setting the stage for being able to better predict

52:23.060 --> 52:24.620
what's going to happen next

52:24.620 --> 52:28.660
and therefore regulating your mood in the moment.

52:28.660 --> 52:30.620
Let's just take a moment and explore that statement

52:30.620 --> 52:32.300
in a little bit more detail.

52:32.300 --> 52:33.500
Essentially what she was saying

52:33.500 --> 52:35.420
and what I'm now again saying

52:35.420 --> 52:38.620
is that your brain and body go through different states.

52:38.620 --> 52:42.220
Your state at a given moment can be labeled as your affect.

52:42.220 --> 52:44.140
Your affect includes a lot of different things,

52:44.140 --> 52:46.580
including levels of autonomic arousal,

52:46.580 --> 52:48.580
levels of hormones, levels of trans mirrors,

52:48.580 --> 52:49.740
all of that stuff.

52:49.740 --> 52:52.660
But it falls under the umbrella of affect.

52:52.660 --> 52:57.500
Affect essentially sets the stage for particular emotions

52:57.500 --> 53:00.300
to be more likely or less likely to emerge.

53:00.300 --> 53:02.860
So emotion and affect aren't the same thing.

53:02.860 --> 53:04.620
Affect is a bit more general.

53:04.620 --> 53:07.180
It sort of undergirds the possibility

53:07.180 --> 53:09.540
of having certain moods like feeling elated,

53:09.540 --> 53:12.540
happy or sad or depressed.

53:12.540 --> 53:14.380
It really sets the general stage

53:14.380 --> 53:17.220
for different types of specific emotions,

53:17.220 --> 53:19.380
even highly specific emotions.

53:19.380 --> 53:22.980
So in that way, when you're taking care of the big six,

53:22.980 --> 53:26.380
when you're tending to these six pillars on a regular basis,

53:26.380 --> 53:28.780
and I should point out that we really want to tend

53:28.780 --> 53:31.060
to those six pillars every single day

53:31.060 --> 53:33.300
or every single 24 hours,

53:33.300 --> 53:35.820
we really need to make those a regular investment

53:35.820 --> 53:37.940
to the extent that we can.

53:37.940 --> 53:41.180
When we do that, we create a neurochemical

53:41.180 --> 53:44.500
and a neural milieu that allows the brain

53:44.500 --> 53:47.180
to be in a better predictive state.

53:47.180 --> 53:51.220
It allows the brain to give rise to certain affects,

53:51.220 --> 53:54.380
spelled A-F-F-E-C-T-S,

53:54.380 --> 53:57.340
so affects that lead to certain emotions

53:57.340 --> 54:00.260
being more or less likely to occur.

54:00.260 --> 54:03.020
Put very simply, when we're tending to those six pillars

54:03.020 --> 54:06.420
on a regular basis, we feel better more generally,

54:06.420 --> 54:10.060
and therefore the emotions that we tend to have

54:10.060 --> 54:11.060
under different conditions,

54:11.060 --> 54:13.260
even conditions of a difficult interaction

54:13.260 --> 54:15.460
with a coworker or with a family member,

54:15.460 --> 54:18.420
tend to be more positive than if we are not tending

54:18.420 --> 54:19.900
to those six pillars.

54:19.900 --> 54:22.580
Now, in some sense, that's sort of a duh statement.

54:22.580 --> 54:24.020
For instance, if you're sleep deprived,

54:24.020 --> 54:25.740
if you're not fed well,

54:25.740 --> 54:27.340
like you haven't eaten in a few hours,

54:27.340 --> 54:29.460
of course, you're going to be more irritable,

54:29.460 --> 54:30.740
you're going to be more reactive,

54:30.740 --> 54:33.460
you are going to be more emotionally labile.

54:33.460 --> 54:34.620
But sleep and nutrition

54:34.620 --> 54:37.180
are just two of those six core pillars.

54:37.180 --> 54:38.900
When we talk about those core pillars

54:38.900 --> 54:40.900
and the necessity for tending to them

54:40.900 --> 54:43.540
on a regular, every 24-hour basis,

54:43.540 --> 54:44.980
what we're really talking about

54:44.980 --> 54:47.500
is creating a milieu within our brain and nervous system

54:47.500 --> 54:50.500
that allows the nervous system to do what it does best,

54:50.500 --> 54:53.500
and in fact, what its main job is to do,

54:53.500 --> 54:55.620
which is to predict what's going to happen next.

54:55.620 --> 54:57.900
Because as Lisa Feldman Barrett pointed out,

54:57.900 --> 55:01.180
emotions are really context-dependent states

55:01.180 --> 55:05.220
that allow us to navigate not just our present circumstances,

55:05.220 --> 55:08.580
but they are our nervous system and brain's best guess

55:08.580 --> 55:12.300
about the circumstances that we are soon going to encounter.

55:12.300 --> 55:13.740
Now, I don't offer you all of that

55:13.740 --> 55:17.460
as kind of a bunch of a tangled mess of nerd speak

55:17.460 --> 55:18.300
to confuse you.

55:18.300 --> 55:21.140
What I'm saying is that by tending to those six core pillars,

55:21.140 --> 55:25.340
you are shifting the likely affects that you will experience

55:25.340 --> 55:27.980
and therefore the likely emotions that you will experience.

55:27.980 --> 55:29.540
So you're biasing your whole system

55:29.540 --> 55:33.420
towards more positive affect and more positive emotions,

55:33.420 --> 55:36.540
regardless of what your life circumstances happen to be

55:36.540 --> 55:38.500
and the stressors that you encounter.

55:38.500 --> 55:40.300
And indeed, you also are including

55:40.300 --> 55:42.700
that six pillar of stress control.

55:42.700 --> 55:44.540
So when those stressors arrive,

55:44.540 --> 55:47.100
you'll be better able to navigate them.

55:47.100 --> 55:49.380
Now, this view of emotion regulation,

55:49.380 --> 55:51.020
of mood and mental health,

55:51.060 --> 55:53.220
is certainly not a novel concept.

55:53.220 --> 55:55.820
People have talked about the physiological regulation of mood

55:55.820 --> 55:58.540
from the time of William James and even earlier.

55:58.540 --> 56:00.420
It's been a long-standing question, for instance,

56:00.420 --> 56:02.700
or debate in psychology and philosophy.

56:02.700 --> 56:06.140
Do we feel anxiety in our body and then label it as anxiety,

56:06.140 --> 56:09.620
or do we feel anxiety in our mind and then our body follows?

56:09.620 --> 56:10.900
That's been a long-standing debate

56:10.900 --> 56:13.380
and frankly, there's evidence on both sides,

56:13.380 --> 56:14.700
which leads me to the conclusion,

56:14.700 --> 56:16.700
I think most neurobiologists and psychologists

56:16.700 --> 56:19.220
to the conclusion that those things are interrelated

56:19.220 --> 56:22.020
in a way that we can't really dissociate them completely

56:22.020 --> 56:23.340
at any level, right?

56:23.340 --> 56:24.340
When your heart rate goes up

56:24.340 --> 56:26.140
and you start breathing faster,

56:26.140 --> 56:27.580
if I were to induce that state in you,

56:27.580 --> 56:30.620
you'd probably interpret that as feeling anxious.

56:30.620 --> 56:31.460
In addition to that,

56:31.460 --> 56:32.980
something can make you anxious

56:32.980 --> 56:34.740
before your heart rate and breathing increases

56:34.740 --> 56:36.180
and then your heart rate and breathing increases.

56:36.180 --> 56:38.340
So no need to tease those apart.

56:38.340 --> 56:40.140
But if you think about the brain,

56:40.140 --> 56:42.100
in large part as a prediction machine

56:42.100 --> 56:44.660
and your brain as a metabolic regulator,

56:44.660 --> 56:47.180
it's trying to decide which organs need resources.

56:47.180 --> 56:49.820
How much resource can I dedicate to thinking,

56:49.820 --> 56:53.300
to creativity, to enjoying social interaction,

56:53.300 --> 56:55.260
to paying attention to what somebody else is saying

56:55.260 --> 56:57.340
as opposed to what's going on inside my body?

56:57.340 --> 56:59.140
All of those major functions of the brain

56:59.140 --> 57:01.820
as they relate to affect and emotions

57:01.820 --> 57:03.940
are going to be best supported,

57:03.940 --> 57:06.900
that is biased toward positive mood,

57:06.900 --> 57:10.060
positive affect, positive emotions,

57:10.060 --> 57:13.300
and therefore positive mental health outcomes

57:13.300 --> 57:15.580
when we're tending to those six pillars.

57:15.580 --> 57:17.940
Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett referred to that whole process

57:17.940 --> 57:21.180
as the brain regulating a brain body budget.

57:21.180 --> 57:23.060
And she had beautiful analogies for that budget.

57:23.060 --> 57:24.860
And that's what led to the description

57:24.860 --> 57:27.940
of social interactions as either generating savings

57:27.940 --> 57:31.300
or being neutral or generating a taxed feeling,

57:31.300 --> 57:33.140
literally taxing that brain body budget.

57:33.140 --> 57:34.100
And I love that concept.

57:34.100 --> 57:35.700
And it's one that you can keep in mind.

57:35.700 --> 57:38.620
And indeed we can inject a lot of specificity

57:38.620 --> 57:41.780
into this whole process of improving mood and mental health

57:41.780 --> 57:43.380
through specific protocols.

57:43.380 --> 57:44.820
If you simply remember,

57:44.820 --> 57:49.140
if you make a daily investment in the six core pillars,

57:49.140 --> 57:51.860
you are building up that brain body budget.

57:51.860 --> 57:55.740
You will have more energetic resources to spend

57:55.740 --> 57:58.620
on whatever life circumstances come your way.

57:58.620 --> 58:01.500
Now, before we move into a discussion about protocols

58:01.500 --> 58:03.940
for how to better understand your life narrative

58:03.940 --> 58:06.700
to enhance your sense of self and confidence

58:06.700 --> 58:08.620
and things of that theme,

58:08.620 --> 58:11.300
I briefly want to mention that,

58:11.300 --> 58:13.940
of course there are known tools out there

58:13.940 --> 58:16.460
in the medical community and psychological community

58:16.460 --> 58:18.700
for improving mood and mental health.

58:18.700 --> 58:21.980
And while there are a variety of tools,

58:21.980 --> 58:24.940
one of the main tools of the psychiatrist

58:24.940 --> 58:26.780
is prescription drugs

58:26.780 --> 58:29.700
that target specific neuromodulator systems

58:29.700 --> 58:30.540
in the brain and body.

58:30.540 --> 58:32.580
For instance, SSRI,

58:32.580 --> 58:35.100
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

58:35.100 --> 58:37.820
or atypical antidepressants

58:37.820 --> 58:40.620
that target the dopamine and epinephrine systems

58:40.620 --> 58:42.660
such as wellbutrin, bupryorone

58:42.660 --> 58:44.580
or other types of antidepressants.

58:44.580 --> 58:48.460
Or for instance, nowadays there's a lot of growing excitement

58:48.460 --> 58:52.660
about clinical trials using relatively high dosages

58:52.660 --> 58:55.580
of psilocybin, which by the way,

58:55.580 --> 58:58.860
closely mimics the chemical serotonin.

58:58.860 --> 58:59.940
That's right, psilocybin,

58:59.940 --> 59:03.060
which is converted to psilocin in the brain.

59:03.060 --> 59:04.260
If you look at it chemically,

59:04.260 --> 59:06.180
it looks very much like serotonin

59:06.180 --> 59:08.420
although it has distinct effects from serotonin.

59:08.420 --> 59:09.620
I talked about psilocybin

59:09.620 --> 59:11.860
and what's being done in terms of the clinical trials,

59:11.860 --> 59:13.660
safety considerations.

59:13.660 --> 59:15.860
I talked about the potential hazard considerations

59:15.860 --> 59:17.940
and where the legality and all of that is going

59:17.940 --> 59:20.220
in that episode if you want to check that out.

59:20.220 --> 59:22.820
But the reason I'm taking a moment to mention these drugs,

59:22.820 --> 59:26.060
things like SSRIs, Prozax, Olav, Citalopram,

59:26.060 --> 59:29.060
wellbutrin, psilocybin and so on

59:29.060 --> 59:33.180
is that all of them target specific neuromodulator systems

59:33.180 --> 59:34.580
in the brain and body.

59:34.580 --> 59:37.980
And at the same time, it's fairly clear

59:38.020 --> 59:40.980
that mood disorders such as major depression

59:40.980 --> 59:43.420
are not necessarily deficits

59:43.420 --> 59:45.180
in things like serotonin or dopamine.

59:45.180 --> 59:48.340
They can be, but most often they are not.

59:48.340 --> 59:52.220
So why are such drugs prescribed for mood disorders

59:52.220 --> 59:53.380
and for mental health disorders?

59:53.380 --> 59:55.860
Well, because if specific neuromodulators

59:55.860 --> 59:58.420
like serotonin, dopamine or epinephrine

59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.900
are dramatically increased above baseline,

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.220
that affords the brain the ability to rewire itself.

01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:08.060
Really the way to think about SSRIs

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.300
or atypical antidepressants or psilocybin

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.060
for the treatment of major depression

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:18.300
is really to think about them as chemical tools

01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.260
to open or access neuroplasticity.

01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.060
And that's why it's oh so important

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.500
that those drugs be combined with talk therapy

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.020
where people are actively working through the sources,

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:30.380
the real life sources and the historical sources,

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:33.460
maybe even the trauma-based sources of their depression.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:36.660
And I mention this because there's a lot of debate nowadays

01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:39.140
as to whether or not these drugs are useful,

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:42.140
whether or not the side effect profiles justify their use,

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:46.900
whether or not they are applicable to young populations.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.180
There's a lot of debate about this.

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:51.220
And certainly in the case of the psychedelics,

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.140
there's a lot, a lot of debate

01:00:53.140 --> 01:00:55.420
because this is a newly emerging area

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:56.860
and there's still not a lot of data,

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.060
although it's starting to increase over time.

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:03.460
But the key point here is that all of these drugs

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.420
have the potential to work in some people, not others.

01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:08.500
Some people, they simply don't work for

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.380
and they cause more problems than solutions they solve,

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:17.220
but they tend to work by increasing the propensity

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:21.540
for neuroplasticity by changing the neuromodulator milieu

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.420
in the brain.

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.740
And this is an important point when thinking about tools

01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:26.860
for enhancing mood and mental health,

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.700
that when we think about tools

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.620
for enhancing mood and mental health.

01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.540
And next, of course, we're going to talk about the tools

01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:38.140
that are specifically designed to target a specific aspect

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:41.100
of one's life story or concept of self.

01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:45.260
All of that is always operating on a backdrop of two things,

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.860
that overall neurochemical milieu and autonomic function

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:50.860
that the six pillars relate to and support

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:52.340
if we're attending to those,

01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.420
but any improvement in mood and mental health

01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:57.020
that's going to be significant, it's going to be noticeable

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:58.300
and it's going to be stable,

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.260
it's going to be pervasive over time,

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:03.380
is going to require that some degree of neuroplasticity,

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:06.020
some degree of neural rewiring occur.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:07.180
So I'm not bringing up the topic

01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:09.380
of these particular drug tools to say that

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.740
they are the best way to improve mood and mental health.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:12.820
I'm certainly not saying that.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.740
They are, but one way to potentially improve

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:16.980
mood and mental health.

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:18.420
And if they are going to work,

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:21.540
they always work best when done in concert

01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:22.380
with talk therapy,

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.860
because they are opening the opportunity

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:24.820
for neuroplasticity,

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:27.540
but then that neuroplasticity has to be directed

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.540
toward a particular endpoint.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.900
There has to be specific work that's being done

01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:35.180
by the individual or ideally the individual

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:39.380
with an expert trained clinically certified therapist

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:43.380
or psychologist or psychiatrist in order to make sure

01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.700
that the neuroplastic changes that occur

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:47.460
lead to longstanding improvements

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.060
in mood and mental health over time.

01:02:49.060 --> 01:02:51.380
Indeed, the drugs that I just described

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:55.460
were originally designed as tools to allow people

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:57.820
to access changes within their brain

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:00.140
that would then allow them to enhance mood

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.220
and mental health, but not have to rely

01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.620
on the drugs themselves for improved mood and mental health.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.620
And along those lines, I'm sure some of you out there

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.900
are thinking about the supplement-based

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.300
or nutrition-based approaches

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:14.020
to enhancing these neuromodulators.

01:03:14.020 --> 01:03:16.540
And indeed, while they don't have the same potency

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:18.540
as things like Wellbutrin and SSRIs

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.180
at increasing things like dopamine

01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.860
and serotonin respectively,

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:23.260
there is a growing number of people out there

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.940
that are relying on daily supplementation

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:29.260
with anywhere from one to three grams of L-tyrosine,

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:31.420
amino acid precursor to dopamine,

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:36.180
combined with often 300 to 600 milligrams of alpha-GPC

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.460
as a way to enhance dopamine and acetylcholine

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:43.380
and to set the stage for elevated levels of neuroplasticity.

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.420
But it's very important to point out

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.620
that the amino acid precursors

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.980
to the various neuromodulators like L-tyrosine,

01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:54.020
like L-tryptophan, so L-tyrosine precursor to dopamine,

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:57.660
L-tryptophan precursor to serotonin, and so on,

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:00.660
that those don't have the same degree of potency,

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.180
that is ability to enhance those neuromodulators.

01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:06.260
And so the extent to which they enrich the possibility

01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:09.020
for neuroplasticity still remains somewhat obscure.

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:11.620
There haven't been clinical trials on that yet,

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:14.300
at least not clinical trials that I am aware of.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:16.340
So I mentioned all of that stuff about drugs,

01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.540
whether or not it's psychedelics

01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.380
or whether or not it's prescription antidepressants

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:21.340
or whether or not people are using

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:24.900
a supplement-based amino acid-based protocol

01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:27.620
for increasing certain neuromodulators.

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.420
I feel it was important to mention all of that because,

01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.060
well, first of all, it's quite prominent out there,

01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:34.260
certainly in the case of prescription antidepressants,

01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.340
and there's growing prominence

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:39.620
and use of relatively high dose psilocybin.

01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:43.380
Again, always done with support talk therapy.

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.340
This is done in a legal setting.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.140
I said legal, not illegal,

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.060
a legal setting with a board-certified therapist.

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.340
This is being done on university campuses,

01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:54.620
within research labs.

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:56.300
And of course, I acknowledge that there are people

01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:58.180
who are using these compounds

01:04:58.180 --> 01:04:59.700
outside the realm of the university

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:01.260
clinical study environment.

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.500
So I mentioned these chemicals,

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.500
not because I'm pointing to them as the path

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:07.700
to improved mood and mental health.

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:09.500
They can be, but they aren't always,

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.500
and as I mentioned before,

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.300
they can sometimes cause problems

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.540
that lead people to wish that they hadn't taken them

01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.740
or to decide to not take them any further,

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:18.340
a decision that absolutely has to be made

01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.540
with a healthcare professional

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.140
who's well certified to do that.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:22.900
But I'm mentioning these tools

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:27.900
because I want you to understand if they work, why they work.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:30.220
And one key point that was really emphasized

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.260
by Dr. Paul Conti, who, as I mentioned before,

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:34.140
is a psychiatrist,

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:35.980
so he uses pharmacology in his practice,

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.260
although he uses other non-pharmacologic tools as well,

01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:42.460
is that these pharmacologic tools are never to be viewed

01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.460
as the be all end all of enhancing mood and mental health.

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:48.860
They are but one path to improving mood and mental health

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:51.300
and indeed should be viewed as a path

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.260
to getting people who are otherwise unable to engage

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.740
in those six core pillars,

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.420
those first principles of mental health,

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.980
to be able to do those things on a regular basis.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:04.420
And then perhaps, based on a discussion with their clinician,

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:07.220
these people could come off those pharmacologic agents.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.300
Maybe yes, maybe no.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:09.540
It depends on the individual.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:11.300
It depends on the circumstances.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:12.860
But those core six pillars,

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.220
those first principles of mental health

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.580
that include but are not limited to those core six pillars

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.660
are absolutely essential.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.420
There's no drug that can replace those core six pillars.

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:26.540
I'd like to take a quick break

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.940
and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.420
InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:34.100
that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:35.740
to help you better understand your body

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.500
and help you reach your health goals.

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:38.620
I've long been a believer

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:40.260
in getting regular blood work done

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:42.100
for the simple reason that many of the factors

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.340
that impact your immediate and long-term health

01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.180
can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

01:06:47.180 --> 01:06:50.100
A major problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,

01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:52.860
is that you get information back about metabolic factors,

01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.540
lipids and hormones and so forth,

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.580
but you don't know what to do with that information.

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:58.780
With InsideTracker, they make it very easy

01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:00.700
because they have a personalized platform

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:03.260
that allows you to see the levels of all those things,

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.780
metabolic factors, lipids, hormones, et cetera,

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:08.660
but it gives you specific directives that you can follow

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.980
that relate to nutrition, behavioral modification,

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:12.260
supplements, et cetera,

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:14.540
that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:15.900
that are optimal for you.

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:17.300

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.900
Okay, so setting aside the core six pillars,

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:32.140
let's now talk about other tools for mood and mental health

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:36.180
that center around really what we more typically think of

01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.980
when we think of mood and mental health, which is emotions.

01:07:39.980 --> 01:07:42.900
When Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett was a guest on the podcast,

01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:45.740
she said something that was really incredible,

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.980
and it's something that's strongly grounded

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:49.340
in excellent scientific data,

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:52.900
which is the more specificity that we can put

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:55.220
to labeling our emotions,

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:56.700
the better off we're going to be

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:59.780
in terms of our overall mental health.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:01.060
Let me restate that.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:04.380
The more specific language that we can put

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.860
to our own internal emotions,

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:09.060
even if that language is just to ourselves

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.260
in our own internal narrative,

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:13.860
we don't even have to speak out what those labels are,

01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:17.300
the better that we're going to feel over time.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.340
And indeed, this effect can be quite rapid.

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.740
And indeed, Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett has done research

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.460
on this very specific topic.

01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:27.940
It's something that's referred to as emotional granularity.

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:31.020
So while some of us move through life

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:35.300
with a sort of what I call emojification of emotions,

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:36.820
you know, you got your happy face, happy,

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.540
your sad face, sad, you know, you're angry, depressed,

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:44.340
anxious, you know, those are labels for emotional states,

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.460
or you could think of them as affects or emotions.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:49.100
I think of them as emotions, but they're not very specific.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.580
They're pretty broad bins.

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:53.900
We say sad or depressed or super depressed

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.300
or super sad, anxious, panic.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.700
And when we think of that as nuance,

01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.660
but it's not very nuanced.

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.140
And Lisa's laboratory and other laboratories

01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:04.300
have explored two things.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.260
First, if people are asked to or encouraged

01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:08.940
to put more granularity, more specificity

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:10.460
on what they're feeling,

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.100
then it seems that their levels of emotional processing

01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.420
are better overall.

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.980
How does that translate to emotions?

01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:20.980
Well, it translates to better overall feelings of wellbeing

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:26.540
when one is placing more specificity on positive emotions.

01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:29.220
And the flip side is also true.

01:09:29.220 --> 01:09:30.580
So this is important to know.

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.180
If one places more specificity on negative emotions,

01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:37.620
it also can enhance one's kind of experience

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:39.460
of those negative emotions.

01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:42.780
Now, that means that this is a two-sided blade, all right?

01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.380
This isn't always a good thing.

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.100
And if one is thinking about protocols

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:48.100
for improving mood and mental health,

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:52.620
the data make very clear that adding more specificity

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.540
to our positive emotions in terms of the language we use,

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:58.060
but also just the depth with which we process

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.060
and think about those positive experiences

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.060
can be very beneficial for us.

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.820
So there are two studies that I'd like to highlight

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:05.100
that relate to this.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.460
The first is entitled Effective Self-Monitoring

01:10:07.460 --> 01:10:08.700
Through Experience Sampling

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:12.420
on Emotion Differentiation in Depression.

01:10:12.420 --> 01:10:14.380
And the second study is entitled

01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:16.060
Emotional Granularity Increases

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.860
with Intensive Ambulatory Assessment.

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:22.420
Methodological and individual factors influence how much.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:24.140
Now, each of these studies focus

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.140
on something slightly different.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:26.420
The first study was mainly focused

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.180
on people who have depression,

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:32.260
and they were cued several, if not many times per day,

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.100
to just think about and report on their emotional state.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.340
And that was done in order to get people

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:40.260
to place more granularity,

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.020
more specificity on what they're feeling,

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.460
but also simply to tap into how they're feeling

01:10:44.460 --> 01:10:46.540
on a more regular basis throughout the day.

01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.540
The second study, which is one that included

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.980
Dr. Lisa Feldman-Behr as an author,

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:53.180
was slightly different because it focused

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:55.180
on non-depressed individuals,

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:56.940
and it cued them to touch into their emotions

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.020
more times per day,

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.420
and it also included some physiological measurements.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:03.500
And one in particular that we're going to talk about

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:04.580
in some detail.

01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.180
Now, I don't have time to go into all the details

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.020
of these studies.

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.900
I may do that in a future podcast episode,

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.500
but the key takeaways are very important

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.220
for all of us to know, which are, first of all,

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:18.260
the more often that you can ask yourself,

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:20.340
what am I really feeling right now?

01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.980
How do I feel?

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:24.100
And, and this is so critical,

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:29.620
the more that you force yourself to not use broad labels

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.980
or simply valence labels.

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:35.700
Valence labels are good or okay or bad.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:40.220
And instead, understand that good is not an emotion.

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:41.860
Okay is not an emotion.

01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:43.380
Bad is not an emotion.

01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.860
But rather saying, you know, I feel, you know,

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.820
curious but a little anxious,

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:48.940
if that happens to be the case.

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:51.900
Or I feel, you know, bored,

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:55.980
but, you know, also a little bit in positive anticipation

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:57.420
about what's going to happen tomorrow.

01:11:57.420 --> 01:11:58.240
Things of that sort,

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.560
putting more nuance and specificity on your emotions,

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.200
but also touching into or thinking

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.160
about your own emotional states more times per day,

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:11.240
clearly has positive outcomes for mood and mental health.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.440
And the reasons for that are incredibly interesting.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.760
And this is something everybody should understand.

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:18.240
Why would it be that putting more specificity

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:19.280
on what we're feeling?

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.240
So perhaps just in our own heads,

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:22.720
like thinking, okay, how do I feel right now?

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.720
Like if I were to do that right now,

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.320
I'd say I feel energized

01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:29.320
and happy.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:31.120
I do, I really enjoy doing what I'm doing.

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:35.200
So I wouldn't say I'm like off the charts in awe

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.480
or elation, but I'm very happy and I feel energized.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:39.320
You know, earlier today,

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:41.940
I was feeling a little bit fatigued

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.880
and a little bit confused

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.320
because I was trying to sort out something

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:47.920
and it wasn't making sense to me.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.160
So assessments like that,

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.140
which can be told to somebody else

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:54.140
or that we just hold internally,

01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:55.640
done repeatedly throughout the day,

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.000
anywhere from three to six times throughout the day,

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.840
just periodically pinging ourselves.

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:00.900
Maybe you set an alarm

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:03.760
or maybe you just decide to every once in a while,

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.840
maybe every time you go into an elevator

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.160
or every time you go up a flight of stairs,

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.640
you just ask yourself, yeah, how do I feel right now?

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.480
And thinking about that for a moment.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.840
And you don't have to write it down,

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.320
although I suppose you could.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:16.840
What turns out that just that practice

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.840
can really enhance our so-called emotional granularity

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.680
that can enhance our positive emotions and affect.

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.760
And in addition, it provides us a better sensitivity

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.640
to better understand those negative emotions,

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.660
which sounds like it might be a bad thing,

01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:35.560
but those negative emotions have information in them.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:37.200
Right, this is one thing that's often lost

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.280
in those broad categorizations of anxious

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.800
or sad or depressed.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.640
And keep in mind, of course,

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.640
that some people are genuinely clinically depressed

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.360
and that needs to be taken extremely seriously,

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.280
just like some people are genuinely clinically anxious

01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.280
and that needs to be taken seriously.

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:54.560
But most of us, when we throw out the words depressed,

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.360
angry, sad, we're not using enough nuance

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.960
and it doesn't really apply to our internal states

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.480
or the circumstances that we're in.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.960
And as a consequence, we suffer.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.920
It's not just about communicating our emotions,

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.800
we suffer because the data say that the more nuance,

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:12.640
the more emotional granularity that we have,

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:16.320
the richer is our experience of the positive aspects of life

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.580
and the more effectively we can navigate

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:23.320
the negative aspects of life, right?

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:26.100
Again, negative emotions perhaps isn't the best way

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:28.440
to even describe negative emotions

01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.980
because that label negative implies that we should avoid it.

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.540
And in fact, those negative emotions

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:35.580
provide a lot of information about perhaps

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.620
social interactions that we should seek to avoid

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.980
in the future and so on and so forth.

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.500
Now, one of the most interesting things

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.820
about this whole process of increasing emotional granularity

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:47.340
and touching in several times per day

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.420
into how we feel, something that's completely zero cost,

01:14:50.420 --> 01:14:52.060
takes just a moment to do,

01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:53.740
that we can get much better at over time.

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.320
That was clearly seen in these studies

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:56.980
that people get much better at doing this.

01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:00.060
It becomes more facile for them very quickly

01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:02.860
is that it correlates with improvements

01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.700
in physiological metrics that relate

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.660
to overall improvements in mood and mental health.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:12.180
And the specific physiological metric that I'm referring to

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.420
is so-called vagal tone.

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.380
Some of you have perhaps heard of the vagus nerve.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.640
It's the 10th cranial nerve.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.600
It's an extensive peripheral nerve

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.320
that it goes out of the brain at the level of the neck.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.720
It's one of the cranial nerves that extends

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:29.800
to essentially all the organs of the body,

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.200
the heart, the lungs, et cetera, but it's a two-way street.

01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:34.100
It's a superhighway of nerves out of the brain

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:37.360
and into the body, and it's a superhighway of nerves

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.560
back from the bodily organs to the brain.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:43.520
And it's involved in regulating a lot of

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.920
so-called autonomic functions.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:46.680
So how fast our heart rate is,

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:49.280
how fast our breathing is, rates of digestion.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.240
And all of that weaves together to create those things

01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:55.400
that we call affect our internal states.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.720
So without going into a ton of detail about the vagus nerve,

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:02.160
there's something that's called cardiac vagal control.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.660
Cardiac vagal control is the extent to which

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:07.880
that vagus nerve can impact your heart rate

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:12.000
and your overall feelings of calm or alertness.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.440
Now, the simple way to think about this

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.840
is more commonly referred to as heart rate variability.

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.920
Heart rate variability is simply the distance

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:20.900
between your heartbeats,

01:16:20.900 --> 01:16:23.340
or rather the time between your heartbeats,

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:26.880
which we know if those timings between your heartbeats

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:28.600
are somewhat variable,

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.940
that is correlated with positive physical

01:16:31.940 --> 01:16:33.880
and mental health outcomes.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.020
One of the ways that you can increase heart rate variability

01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:39.200
is to get regular cardiovascular exercise,

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.120
as well as doing resistance exercise,

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.320
and no surprise, getting sufficient amounts

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.480
of quality sleep each night is also going to be

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.380
very beneficial for heart rate variability.

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.900
Now, exercise and sleep, of course, are wonderful,

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.100
but it turns out that there's also a very rapid way

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.080
to increase heart rate variability

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.840
by activating the vagal innervation of the heart

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.940
and the way that the heart and some other circuits

01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.080
within the so-called brainstem interact.

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:10.280
And that's through something called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.200
Respiratory sinus arrhythmia can be summarized very simply

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:19.000
by saying when you inhale, you speed your heart rate up,

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.080
and when you exhale, you slow your heart rate down.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.920
And it's that exhale, slowing your heart rate down

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.280
that's mediated by the vagus nerve.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.680
Now, there's a more thorough description of that,

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.200
which I'll just give you now, and it's not that lengthy.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:34.860
So here's how it goes.

01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:39.840
When you inhale, your diaphragm actually moves down,

01:17:39.840 --> 01:17:43.580
and as a consequence, your heart actually gets a little bigger,

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.120
has a little more space.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.880
As a consequence, the fluid in your heart

01:17:46.880 --> 01:17:49.600
moves a little more slowly per unit volume,

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.040
and there's a neural signal to speed the heart up.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:56.020
Conversely, when you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:58.280
That means there's a little less space for the heart

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.000
in the general area where it's sitting,

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.120
so the heart gets a little bit smaller,

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.080
a little more compact.

01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.720
That means that the fluid in your heart

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.760
is moving more quickly through that smaller space,

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.160
and there's a neural signal mediated by the vagus

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:10.920
to slow the heart down.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.940
So that's why inhale, speed your heart up,

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.460
and exhales, slow your heart down.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:18.200
That is the basis of so-called RSA,

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:20.840
or respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.420
Now, what does any of that have to do

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.400
with the granularity of language

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.040
that we place on our emotions?

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:30.320
Turns out there's several studies showing

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:35.080
that when people place more descriptive granularity

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.700
on their emotions, that is correlated with, okay?

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.020
It's not causal, but it's correlated with improvements

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.060
in respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.980
which we know correlate with improvements

01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:46.460
in heart rate variability.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.620
Indeed, it's one of the major bases

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.020
for heart rate variability,

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.620
which we know is correlated

01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.780
with not just positive physical health outcomes,

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.820
but positive mental health outcomes,

01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:59.540
including lower levels of anxiety, improved sleep,

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.240
and overall levels of mood.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:03.520
This is a topic that I'm very familiar with,

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.620
because last year, my laboratory

01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:07.260
at Stanford University School of Medicine

01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.200
in collaboration with a colleague of mine,

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.620
Dr. David Spiegel, our Associate Chair of Psychiatry,

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:15.020
also at Stanford University School of Medicine,

01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.080
published a clinical trial in Cell Reports Medicine,

01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.420
showing that there's a particular pattern of breathing

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:25.120
that people can do for just five minutes per day

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.540
that is effective in significantly improving

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:33.540
various metrics related to mood, and reducing anxiety,

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:35.940
and also improving sleep.

01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.740
Although I should say the protocol I'm about to describe

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:42.460
didn't uniformly improve all of those metrics.

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.540
It had a bigger effect on some versus others.

01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:47.260
I'll provide a link to that study in the show note captions.

01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.620
But if you're wondering what this protocol is

01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:51.240
that people did for five minutes a day

01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:52.820
that allowed them to, by the way,

01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:54.580
pervasively improve their mood.

01:19:54.580 --> 01:19:55.740
So it wasn't just their mood

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.300
while they were doing this five minute a day protocol.

01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:02.260
It was improvements in mood around the clock, essentially,

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:04.640
as well as improvements in other physiological metrics

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:07.640
and other aspects of those six core pillars.

01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:11.560
It was that physiological sigh that we talked about earlier.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.520
Although in this case,

01:20:12.520 --> 01:20:15.160
we didn't have people do just one physiological sigh.

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.740
We had people set aside five minutes per day.

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.320
So set a timer for five minutes.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:20.800
They could sit or lie down.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.860
They could do it any time of day.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:27.100
And we just had them repeat that physiological sigh

01:20:27.100 --> 01:20:29.360
for a duration of five minutes total

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:32.440
so that they would do two inhales through the nose,

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:35.200
and then a full exhale to lungs empty through the mouth.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:36.840
Then they would do it again,

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.860
and then they would do it again.

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.320
And again, until those five minutes were completed.

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.660
Again, the outcome of that clinical trial

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:45.520
was that that particular pattern of breathing,

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.920
which we called cyclic physiological sighing

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.680
for five minutes per day,

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.880
again, done any time of day,

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:54.240
had the most positive outcomes

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.520
in terms of improving mood and mental health

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:57.660
and autonomic function,

01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:00.560
those things related to sleep and heart rate variability.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:04.140
So that's a very simple, very minimal time investment,

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:06.820
zero cost tool that anyone can use

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.200
that again improves various metrics of physical health,

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.640
but also improves metrics of mental health.

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:16.320
And it ties right back in with what was observed

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:19.480
in the work by Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett,

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:24.260
exploring how putting more word label,

01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:27.400
emotional granularity on one's emotional states

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.680
positively impact our physiological state.

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:31.400
And the fact that thinking about our emotions

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.240
more frequently throughout the day

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.120
and deliberately putting more label granularity

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:40.720
on those emotions frequently throughout the day

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.800
is correlated with this improvement

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.480
in respiratory sinus arrhythmia and heart rate variability.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.400
The fact that these things all relate to one another

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:50.520
should not surprise us because indeed

01:21:50.520 --> 01:21:52.080
there's a previous paper,

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:54.040
this is a quite extensive review.

01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:55.980
Actually, it's a very nice review.

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:57.800
It's one that I encourage anyone who's interested

01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:59.320
in these topics to explore,

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:01.920
especially psychologists who might have a interest

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.720
in physiology or psychiatrists

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:07.040
or simply people who are interested in mind-body stuff.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:09.200
This is a review published in 2017

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.080
in the journal, Biological Psychology,

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.180
entitled Cardiac Vagal Control

01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:15.920
as a Marker of Emotion Regulation in Healthy Adults,

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:16.760
a review.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.900
And again, it's a really wonderful literature review

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:22.280
of the peer-reviewed primary research,

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.500
which really establishes that this thing, vagal tone,

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.120
our ability to kind of put the brakes

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.380
on our autonomic nervous system

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:32.380
and slow our heart rate down deliberately

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.380
through our breathing,

01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:36.100
and perhaps even just by stopping and reflecting

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:38.300
on what our emotional states are

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:40.860
is really beneficial for our overall mood

01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:41.700
and mental health.

01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:43.340
And I want to highlight, bold,

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.980
and underline that word overall,

01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:47.140
because it's not just the case

01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:49.560
that people experience elevated mood and mental health

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.940
in the moments where they stop and go,

01:22:50.940 --> 01:22:52.140
oh, how am I feeling?

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:55.980
Oh, you know, am I feeling bored or agitated?

01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:58.180
Do I feel particularly excited?

01:22:58.180 --> 01:23:02.180
Sure, that can have some impact on physiological metrics

01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:03.300
and mood and mental health,

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.260
but in all of these studies,

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:08.260
the outcome seems to be that people's overall levels

01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:09.960
of mood and mental health are enhanced,

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:12.100
not just while they're thinking about their emotions

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.700
or doing this five-minute-a-day cyclic sighing,

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:17.020
but around the clock, which is really terrific

01:23:17.020 --> 01:23:18.920
because I think that's what most all of us want,

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:20.880
which is improved mood and mental health,

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.380
not just in the moments when we do a practice

01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:24.740
or in the few minutes afterwards,

01:23:24.740 --> 01:23:27.100
but 24 hours a day.

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:29.140
I suppose we might segment out sleep

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:31.100
during which, you know, hopefully we're having great dreams

01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:33.120
as opposed to other kinds of dreams.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:37.260
But the point is everyone, I have to imagine,

01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:38.620
would like to feel better

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:40.700
and have elevated mood and mental health

01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.140
during the times when they're awake.

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.460
And indeed, these sorts of protocols

01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:45.760
have been shown to do that,

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.860
or so say the scientific data.

01:23:47.860 --> 01:23:49.540
Now we are going to discuss the tools

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:51.660
for enhancing mood and mental health

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.640
gleaned from the four-episode guest series

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.180
with Dr. Paul Conti,

01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:58.440
who is a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.240
He also has particular expertise in trauma.

01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:02.860
However, the four-episode guest series

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:04.360
that we did with Dr. Conti

01:24:04.360 --> 01:24:06.840
was really about exploring the self,

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:09.160
as well as tools and protocols

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.120
for not just gaining a better understanding of oneself,

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:14.000
but also for gaining a better understanding

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.160
and tools for relating to others, AKA relationships.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:20.440
Thread through the series was a model of the mind

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.700
and how it works to create everything

01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:25.660
from feelings, thoughts, to behaviors

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.900
that Dr. Paul Conti described as an iceberg model.

01:24:28.900 --> 01:24:31.000
And I perhaps should refer you to the fact

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.220
that he actually drew out this model

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.760
and we provided it as a zero-cost PDF

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.880
in the show note captions

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.900
for every single one of those episodes

01:24:38.900 --> 01:24:40.740
in that four-episode series.

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:42.980
We also provide a link to this model

01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:46.060
in the show note captions for this tools episode.

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:47.860
The model is called the iceberg model.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:50.620
And as the name suggests, it resembles an iceberg

01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:54.380
in which the vast majority of our mind's processing

01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:58.080
occurs below our conscious awareness in our unconscious mind.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.420
So that's the portion of the iceberg

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:01.360
that resides below the surface.

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.180
Whereas the portion of our mental processing

01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:06.800
that we are aware of resides above the water surface,

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:08.260
the so-called conscious mind.

01:25:08.260 --> 01:25:10.140
So a key aspect of the iceberg model

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:12.840
is that the unconscious mind is responsible

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:15.540
for the vast majority of our feelings,

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:16.960
thoughts, and behaviors,

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.280
but that we are not aware

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.760
of how this unconscious mind is doing that.

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.160
And by extension, the tools and protocols

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:24.760
that Dr. Conti described,

01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.880
largely deal with going into the unconscious

01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.200
and figuring out how the unconscious processing

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:32.540
is influencing our conscious processing,

01:25:32.540 --> 01:25:34.960
both in healthy and in unhealthy ways.

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.620
And when we say in healthy and unhealthy ways,

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:40.880
we're largely referring to the presence of defenses.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.120
So some of you have perhaps heard of defenses before.

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:45.280
Some defenses can indeed be healthy

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.960
and others are unhealthy.

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.840
There are defenses such as projection, sublimation, denial.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.680
And during the course of that four episode series,

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.800
Dr. Conti explains how projections

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.040
are not always bad for us.

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.680
Indeed, they can protect us from panic, from severe trauma,

01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.180
but they also can create difficulties

01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.760
in processing our own understanding of self

01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.040
and of our life experiences

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.680
in ways that can actually be damaging to us.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:13.380
So a key takeaway from that four episode series

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:15.520
is to understand and acknowledge

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.600
that your unconscious mind is driving

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.080
much of what you feel, think and do.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.480
However, by doing structured exploration of the self,

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:25.320
and we'll talk about how to do that,

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.000
one can gain better understanding

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.840
of how that unconscious processing

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:32.960
is influencing what you think, feel, believe and do.

01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.080
So once you accept the important role of the unconscious mind

01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:37.640
and you make the decision that you want

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.840
to better understand how your unconscious mind

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:42.200
and conscious mind are in this constant dialogue

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.120
and how you can have that dialogue better serve you,

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:48.120
there are a series of actionable tools that you can do

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.080
that will allow you to better understand yourself

01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.640
and how you relate to others.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.040
And the first of these tools

01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:57.080
is to really understand your self concept.

01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:00.200
Now, of course, most all of us know our own name.

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.120
Rarely do we ever forget that name.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:03.920
We have some concept of where we're from,

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.660
who our parents are, what our present and future goals

01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:09.180
might be, where we've succeeded,

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.620
where we failed in life and on and on.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:13.480
But the self concept goes far beyond

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:17.680
that sort of CV list or our biography of self.

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.920
Indeed, the self concept has a lot to do

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:23.880
with our self confidence, our feelings of ability,

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:26.040
both to overcome challenges,

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:29.000
but also our ability to serve the world that we're in

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.600
and our ability to change ourselves over time.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:33.600
Now, of course, the degree to which somebody

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:36.080
might have confidence or less confidence

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:37.480
or the degree to which somebody feels

01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.880
that they can exert influence on their environment

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:42.320
and their goals is of course going to vary

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.300
based on their personal history.

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:48.160
But as Dr. Conti explained, even independent of all that,

01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.040
if one puts in some work to better understand

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:53.920
their self concept, to really get a clear picture

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:57.800
of one's self, from that one can develop more agency

01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:00.440
with which to pursue one's aspirations

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.000
and to reach their goals.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.840
And the key concept here is one that's particularly powerful

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.660
for both exploring and building up one's concept of self.

01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.960
And that's to consciously and deliberately build

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.160
a life narrative.

01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:15.940
Now, a simple way to do this that can be very effective

01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:19.500
is to create a series of folders or documents.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.240
It could even be a stack of papers.

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.560
I prefer to do this in electronic form.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:26.000
And I confess that even before learning about this tool

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.160
from Dr. Conti, I had initiated doing this tool

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:31.400
starting back in 2015.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:34.240
And it's fairly straightforward, but as I mentioned before,

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:35.640
it can be very powerful.

01:28:35.640 --> 01:28:39.280
And it simply consists of building out separate folders

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.840
or pieces of paper, and this could be done electronically

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:44.400
or on real world paper with paper and pen

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.480
or paper and pencil.

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:48.120
And essentially what you do is you're going to divide

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:51.800
your life history into some regular increments.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.320
So for me, the way that I did this is I created a folder

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:57.760
on my laptop that I actually call Lifetime.

01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.100
So that's the title of the main folder.

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:01.480
And then within that folder, I have a series of folders,

01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.720
each of which spans a particular phase of my life.

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.080
So zero to five years of age, six to 10 years of age,

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:11.200
11 to 15 years of age, and so on and so forth.

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.240
Now I'm 48 years old, so I have folders that extend

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:17.560
to age 50 currently, although I will add folders

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.080
going forward very soon.

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:21.760
And the idea here is that for each of those folders,

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:24.080
you're going to place a single word document

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.200
into that folder.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.760
And then on that word document, you're not going to journal,

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.480
you're not going to do any sort of extensive writing,

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.600
rather you're simply going to put down bullet points

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:37.740
with titles, it could be one or two sentences,

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:40.080
but typically it's just a few words describing

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.940
some of the key milestone events that you remember

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.040
from that particular phase of your life.

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.920
So just for sake of example, I'll read off some

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.200
of the things that are included in the folders

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:51.780
for my particular lifetime narrative.

01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.160
But of course, this relates to my lifetime narrative,

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.160
you should of course, put the milestones

01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:58.920
and key bullet points that relate to your lifetime narrative.

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:00.800
But again, just to give you a sense of the sorts of things

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:02.720
that made it into this folder,

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:07.080
in my six years old to 11 year old folder,

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:09.900
on that document, I put where I was living at that time,

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:12.140
the city I was living, the school that I went to,

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:14.660
I put a couple of teachers names,

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:17.220
teachers that had a particular influence on me,

01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:19.580
a particular summer camp experience,

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.620
that was not a traumatic experience by the way,

01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.600
it was a happy experience, but for me,

01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.960
it turned out to be a very transformative one.

01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:27.980
And then there were a couple other things in there

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:31.500
that are just recollections of childhood friends names.

01:30:31.500 --> 01:30:34.180
So seemingly mundane information perhaps,

01:30:34.180 --> 01:30:36.520
but it looks more or less like a biography

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.140
and yet other folders.

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:42.180
So for instance, the folder that spans from 25

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:44.940
to 30 years of age is the time that I was

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:47.140
in graduate school, so it includes a note

01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:49.340
about graduate school, a note about particular hobbies

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:50.620
that I was interested in,

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:52.820
in addition to my scientific research at the time,

01:30:52.820 --> 01:30:54.300
a couple of key relationships,

01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:56.540
a couple of key relationship challenges,

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.580
as well as some things that at that time,

01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:00.700
I was processing about prior years,

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:03.340
in particular my teen years in high school.

01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:05.220
Now, the key thing here is that whatever goes

01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:07.660
into these folders is what's important to you.

01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:10.500
It could be positive events, it could be negative events.

01:31:10.500 --> 01:31:13.440
It could be events that for whatever reason you remember

01:31:13.440 --> 01:31:15.560
and that keep surfacing in your mind

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:17.620
that you think might be interesting or important

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:19.580
at some later time or that you're concerned

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:20.420
you might forget.

01:31:20.420 --> 01:31:22.100
In fact, that might be a really good metric

01:31:22.100 --> 01:31:23.740
for whether or not you include something

01:31:23.740 --> 01:31:24.940
in these folders or not.

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:26.520
If there's something that you want to make sure

01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:29.900
that you never forget, but that you think you might forget,

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:32.020
I would encourage you to put it onto that word document

01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:34.020
and put it into that particular folder.

01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:37.780
Again, this isn't about creating a coherent life story.

01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:40.460
This is about creating a series of segments

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:43.500
of small collections of key life events,

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:46.260
positive, negative, neutral, inspiring,

01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:48.420
basically anything that was salient for you

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.980
at that particular time.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.540
And of course, if you want to put reflections

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.020
about those particular events into that word document,

01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.380
you're more than welcome to do that.

01:31:56.380 --> 01:32:01.020
But the basis of this self-concept developing exercise

01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:04.340
is just that, it's to develop a historical sense

01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:05.340
of yourself.

01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:07.380
Of course, bringing you up to present day

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:09.420
where you will continue to add things

01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:12.100
to whatever word document goes into that particular folder

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:13.900
for the age you happen to be now.

01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:14.740
Now, for some of you,

01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:17.580
this kind of autobiographical bullet pointing

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.020
might seem like it's just that,

01:32:19.020 --> 01:32:21.900
some attempt to build or write an autobiography.

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:24.100
But it's very important to remember

01:32:24.100 --> 01:32:26.040
that these folders are for you.

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:28.260
These folders are not about writing a book

01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.220
about your life history.

01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:31.660
Although if you decide to do that with these folders

01:32:31.660 --> 01:32:34.580
at some point down the line, that sounds great,

01:32:34.580 --> 01:32:36.540
but that's not the goal here.

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:39.100
The goal is for you to build a structured,

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:41.540
narrative representation of events

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:43.500
that were key in your life.

01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:45.660
And as described in the series with Dr. Conti,

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:49.100
this goes way beyond just understanding your past.

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.180
This is really about understanding past.

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:53.260
It's about understanding yourself at present.

01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:55.620
And indeed it threads into your goals

01:32:55.620 --> 01:32:57.580
and aspirations for the future.

01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.500
An important thing to understand about this tool

01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:04.060
or protocol is that it also has a incredible ability

01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:08.380
to anchor you in your perception of the passage of time.

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:10.980
Some of us track the passage of time better than others,

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:14.220
both within the day and across days and years and so forth.

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:17.020
But this exercise in particular is very good

01:33:17.020 --> 01:33:20.380
at allowing you to see how much time you devoted

01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:22.540
at a given stage of your life to a given endeavor,

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:24.500
whether or not you're stuck in patterns

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.220
whereby you're still engaging

01:33:26.220 --> 01:33:27.820
in certain types of things professionally

01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.780
or relationship wise,

01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:32.540
or in any other number of different ways

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:35.100
that have you in a pattern

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:37.500
that may or may not be serving you well.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.700
I want to emphasize again that this exercise

01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.540
is not about goal setting.

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.660
It's about your ability to build

01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:45.620
a structured narrative pattern

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.100
from which you can look at it

01:33:48.100 --> 01:33:50.820
and then make a determination as to whether or not,

01:33:50.820 --> 01:33:53.820
you feel that you're currently on the right path for you.

01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:56.180
But it's not about projecting forward

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:57.580
as to what your goals are.

01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:58.740
We'll soon talk about that.

01:33:58.740 --> 01:34:01.060
We'll talk about goals and aspirations in a moment.

01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:03.300
This is really about better understanding

01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:05.980
what led you up to the place that you are now.

01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.060
And it really helps you pinpoint the key work

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.860
that you need to do in terms of exploring your unconscious

01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:12.940
and conscious mind using some tools

01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:14.580
that we're going to get into subsequently.

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:16.020
So there's really no strict rules

01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:18.020
about how to do this exactly,

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.260
except that I do encourage you to make those increments

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:22.300
across your lifespan manageable.

01:34:22.300 --> 01:34:24.740
I wouldn't suggest doing it one for every year.

01:34:24.740 --> 01:34:27.660
I wouldn't suggest a folder, one for every 10 years.

01:34:27.660 --> 01:34:29.980
I think a three to five year increment

01:34:29.980 --> 01:34:31.340
seemed like a more reasonable

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:33.060
and tractable way to go about this.

01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.700
So that's one of the sorts of tools

01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:36.660
that Dr. Conti referred to

01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:39.460
as to how to build up one's self-concept,

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:42.140
which directly relates to things such as our confidence,

01:34:42.140 --> 01:34:44.820
our ability to track our own behavior,

01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:46.540
understand some of our motivations,

01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:48.020
both conscious and unconscious.

01:34:48.020 --> 01:34:51.460
But of course, that practice is mainly a conscious exercise.

01:34:51.460 --> 01:34:54.460
It's really not tapping directly into the unconscious

01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:57.060
in any kind of direct way as far as we know.

01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.340
Now we can contrast that with the tools and protocols

01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.820
that are designed to tap into the unconscious mind.

01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:03.660
And of course, there are a number of different ways

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:05.260
to do this that were discussed

01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:07.620
in that four episode series with Dr. Conti.

01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:09.820
But one of the most powerful ways to do this

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:13.540
is by thinking about and indeed sometimes writing about

01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:16.020
or even analyzing one's dreams.

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:17.660
Now dream analysis is something

01:35:17.660 --> 01:35:19.580
for which you can find a lot of books out there.

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:20.580
There are a lot of theories.

01:35:20.580 --> 01:35:23.020
There's also a lot of argument that perhaps dream analysis,

01:35:23.020 --> 01:35:24.820
which has roots in Freudian psychology,

01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:28.980
as well as other traditions is perhaps not accurate.

01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.300
I don't think we want to consider

01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:32.580
whether or not dream analysis is accurate.

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:35.020
Rather, I think we should just acknowledge

01:35:35.020 --> 01:35:36.540
that when we are dreaming,

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.260
in particular the dreams that we have

01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.220
toward the later part of our night,

01:35:40.220 --> 01:35:41.340
which are the dreams associated

01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:42.940
with rapid eye movement sleep

01:35:42.940 --> 01:35:45.580
that tend to be very emotionally late in dreams

01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.620
as compared to the dreams that we have earlier in the night.

01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:51.260
Well, when we consider the content of those dreams,

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:53.140
even if we're not trying to interpret them,

01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:55.540
it's very clear that those dreams reflect

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:58.100
the unconscious mind controlling more

01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:00.380
of our internal dialogue

01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:02.660
or what we are experiencing at that time.

01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.660
Whereas when we are awake,

01:36:03.660 --> 01:36:06.660
our conscious mind tends to take over more of the narrative,

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.660
the internal narrative and the control

01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:10.260
of our feelings, thoughts and behaviors.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:11.260
But as I mentioned before,

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:14.100
the unconscious mind is always exerting an influence

01:36:14.100 --> 01:36:16.700
regardless of whether or not we are asleep or awake.

01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:19.500
With that said, one way to explore the unconscious mind

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:21.620
and to begin to get a better understanding

01:36:21.620 --> 01:36:23.060
about how it might be influencing

01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:25.540
our waking states and behaviors

01:36:25.540 --> 01:36:29.660
is to actually record and think about one's dreams.

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:31.900
Now, of course, some people remember their dreams

01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:34.340
on a regular basis, other people don't.

01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:37.340
Some people actually believe that they don't dream.

01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:39.580
Studies out of sleep laboratories at Stanford,

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.580
University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and elsewhere

01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:44.100
all generally agree that everybody dreams,

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:46.580
but not everybody remembers their dreams.

01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:50.100
So if you're interested in tapping into an understanding

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:52.940
of what your dreams are telling you,

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:55.140
which is basically a way of saying

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:59.700
what your unconscious mind or dialogue consists of,

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.100
I highly recommend putting a journal.

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.580
So this would be any kind of paper and pen

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:05.900
or paper and pencil type journal.

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:09.140
And the idea is this, if you wake up

01:37:09.140 --> 01:37:12.060
and you can remember your dream,

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:14.860
write down a few key bullet points from that dream.

01:37:14.860 --> 01:37:16.700
If you feel you can write out the dream

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:19.060
in a very linear narrative, this happened,

01:37:19.060 --> 01:37:20.140
then that happened, then this happened,

01:37:20.140 --> 01:37:20.980
then that happened, great.

01:37:20.980 --> 01:37:23.980
But most people find that their memory of their dream

01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:26.020
is rather fragmentary.

01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:28.940
Other people can't remember their dream,

01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:30.580
or at least they wake up,

01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:32.300
they feel like they were having a dream,

01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:35.460
but they can't remember all of it or key components of it.

01:37:35.460 --> 01:37:38.500
And for that, I suggest that you try keeping your body

01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:41.780
completely still and closing your eyes once again.

01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:43.700
We don't quite understand why this is,

01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:47.380
but when you look at the literature on dream recollection,

01:37:47.380 --> 01:37:51.020
it seems that by keeping one's body completely still

01:37:51.020 --> 01:37:53.980
with eyes closed, we have better access

01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:56.420
to whatever the contents of the dream

01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.140
that just occurred were, okay?

01:37:58.140 --> 01:38:00.260
So if you wake up and you can't remember your dreams,

01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:02.740
try lying still for a few minutes

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:05.660
and keeping your eyes closed and seeing whether or not

01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:08.060
that helps surface the content of that dream.

01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:10.220
Other people find that they get up, they get out of bed,

01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:12.460
and then sometime in the middle of the morning,

01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:13.900
maybe even later in the day,

01:38:13.900 --> 01:38:15.780
the contents of a dream will just come to them.

01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:16.980
Well, if that happens, great.

01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:19.900
I also highly recommend that you have a way to write down

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:21.900
the contents of that dream.

01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:23.140
Now, what you're looking for

01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:25.300
when you do this sort of tool or protocol,

01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:28.620
I encourage you to be wary of any immediate interpretation

01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:31.380
of, for instance, okay, animals in a dream mean children,

01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:32.980
although they could.

01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:35.420
There's not a lot of science that really supports that

01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:36.700
as a firm statement.

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:38.900
And of course, there are books out there and podcasts

01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:40.420
and a ton of information

01:38:40.420 --> 01:38:42.060
trying to help you interpret your dreams.

01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:43.460
And while some of that can be fun

01:38:43.460 --> 01:38:45.580
and not all of it is entirely useless,

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.700
the goal here is not to interpret your dreams.

01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:49.680
The goal here is to start recording

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.060
some of the key takeaways,

01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:53.380
maybe even the entire narrative of the dreams

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.620
that you have just prior to waking

01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:57.820
as a way to try and understand some of the themes

01:38:57.820 --> 01:39:02.060
that are occurring and recurring in the dialogue

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.100
that exists within your unconscious mind.

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.220
So a key aspect of this tool is that

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:08.420
you're not going to take any one dream

01:39:08.420 --> 01:39:11.140
as an enormously informative dream.

01:39:11.140 --> 01:39:14.900
It might be, but more important in this particular tool

01:39:14.900 --> 01:39:17.260
is to write down the themes of a particular dream

01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:19.620
and then see whether or not those particular themes

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:23.580
resurface again and again across different nights

01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.240
or across different dreams.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:29.260
The idea here is that things that are repeating thematically

01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:32.860
will show up as different components in different dreams,

01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:35.500
but that by keeping a dream journal,

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:38.200
you can start to identify some of these patterns

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.940
that are occurring from one dream to the next

01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:43.380
as opposed to having the same dream over and over.

01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:45.660
But the point here is that you can explore the contents

01:39:45.660 --> 01:39:48.140
and the themes, that's really the most important word here,

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:51.960
the themes of your unconscious mind that is occurring

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:54.540
if you start thinking about what's recurring

01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:56.440
during your dreams, because dreams are a time

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:59.600
when your unconscious mind is dominating the narrative

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:01.280
within your mind and brain.

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:02.980
Now, for those of you that dream a lot

01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:04.340
and remember your dreams,

01:40:04.340 --> 01:40:06.740
as well as for those of you that do not,

01:40:06.740 --> 01:40:09.960
I would also encourage you to explore the contents

01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:13.820
of your thinking, that is thinking about your thinking

01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.600
during so-called liminal states.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.320
And the liminal state during which this can be

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:20.160
particularly useful is right upon waking.

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.600
So this is different than thinking about

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.340
what you were dreaming about.

01:40:23.340 --> 01:40:26.760
This is about keeping your eyes closed and body still.

01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:29.000
We do think that that's important for doing this well,

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.340
because once you start moving your body,

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:31.760
you open your eyes and you start bringing in

01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.800
sensory experience for that day,

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.680
your mind dramatically shifts towards conscious processing.

01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:40.280
But in that liminal state between sleeping and awake,

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.960
when you wake up and you're a little sleepy,

01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.400
maybe you don't want to get out of bed,

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:45.880
and this happens to me all too often,

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.220
try closing your eyes and remaining perfectly still

01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:51.360
for maybe one to three minutes, maybe five minutes,

01:40:51.360 --> 01:40:54.360
and just pay attention to where your mind goes.

01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:56.720
Now, you might fall back asleep, be mindful of that,

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:59.040
depending on what you need to do that morning.

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:03.080
But a lot of people will find that their mind goes into

01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:05.840
this place that's neither sleep nor awake, right?

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:08.200
This is a state that very much resembles the state

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:11.280
people achieve in things like yoga nidra, yoga sleep,

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.680
or in non-sleep deep rest,

01:41:12.680 --> 01:41:15.040
although it tends to be more dominated

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.080
by the unconscious mind, a little bit more sleep-like.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.840
Now, some people find this practice to be difficult

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.440
because they're the sort of people that wake up

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.700
and they're just immediately ready to go.

01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:26.680
Most people, however, myself included,

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.560
find that when they wake up,

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:30.200
the mind isn't completely alert yet,

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:32.000
and you can use that period,

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:35.560
again, just maybe two or three minutes, maybe five minutes,

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:39.980
to start to pay attention to the contents of your thinking,

01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.760
see whether or not your thinking migrates from

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.760
something related to work or to relationship or to self

01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:49.640
or to something you want to do

01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:53.640
or something that you're anxious about and so on and so on.

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:55.520
And here too, you'll want to write this down.

01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.380
So this is very much like the dream journaling

01:41:57.380 --> 01:41:58.600
we just talked about,

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:01.400
but it's slightly easier for most people to access,

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.160
especially people who have a hard time

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.960
remembering their dreams.

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:07.440
And again, it's an opportunity to access

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:09.920
some of the contents of your unconscious mind,

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:13.360
to learn to look at and see what's going on

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:16.360
in your unconscious mind in a way that's very difficult,

01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:18.040
if not impossible to do,

01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.280
unless you're working with somebody who's very good

01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.360
at accessing the unconscious,

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:25.120
such as a skilled psychiatrist or psychoanalyst,

01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:28.880
and in that way, allowing you to do introspective work,

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:32.360
which is not structured in terms of thinking,

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:33.800
trying to think about like, what do I want?

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:34.960
What's going on?

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:35.800
Why did they do that?

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.920
Why did I react that way?

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:37.760
Nothing like that.

01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:40.240
You're simply observing your mind

01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:43.260
and seeing what's geysering up from the unconscious.

01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:45.660
That is, you're getting a portal

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.660
into that portion of the iceberg

01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:50.440
that resides below the surface of the water.

01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:52.440
The next set of tools for exploring the self,

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.760
self-concept, et cetera,

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:58.120
from that four episode series with Dr. Conti is journaling.

01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.520
I'm going to do an entire episode

01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.560
of the Huberman Lab podcast about journaling.

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:03.400
And there are a lot of different kinds of journaling

01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:05.760
and fortunately, there are a lot of great

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:07.800
peer-reviewed studies about the power of journaling

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:09.280
for processing all sorts of things

01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:11.800
like emotional states, trauma, et cetera.

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:14.240
There are basically two categories of journaling

01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:17.440
that are very useful to carry out on a consistent basis.

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:19.160
And when I say consistent basis,

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:20.200
that could mean every day,

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:21.440
or it could mean three times a week,

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.420
it could even be once a week.

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.320
There are really no hard and fast rules about this,

01:43:25.320 --> 01:43:27.000
but when we think about journaling,

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.880
there are really two main styles of journaling.

01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:30.960
One is going to be free associative journaling.

01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:34.360
Sometimes people talk about this as a data dump, right?

01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:36.600
Typically, people will talk about the data dump

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:38.120
as the morning notes,

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:40.360
which is when you wake up in the morning,

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:41.360
you've got a lot on your mind,

01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:42.600
you can't organize your mind.

01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.240
People who have a hard time structuring their thinking

01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:47.580
and behavior often find this very useful,

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:50.360
which is to take out a journal or a piece of paper.

01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:51.500
Again, this is just for you.

01:43:51.500 --> 01:43:53.220
It's important that you realize

01:43:53.220 --> 01:43:56.640
and really make sure that you're the only person

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.760
that's going to see these notes,

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.000
because a lot of people get into self-monitoring

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:01.280
when they're doing their journaling.

01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:03.200
They're thinking about, well, how's this going to look?

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.180
Is my handwriting okay?

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:05.140
How's my punctuation?

01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.360
What are people going to think?

01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.120
Is this going to be a good book or not a good book?

01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.680
Listen, none of this journaling that we're referring to

01:44:10.680 --> 01:44:14.120
is about your book or your autobiography.

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:16.200
This is really just for you.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.840
This is an exploration of yourself

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.600
that's designed to help you enhance your concept,

01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:22.880
that is your understanding of self,

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:26.240
and indeed translates to better confidence,

01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:28.320
better understanding of your goals and aspirations,

01:44:28.320 --> 01:44:30.800
better understanding of your unhealthy patterns

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.560
and defenses and on and on.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:35.280
And so again, the two styles of journaling

01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:36.560
are free association.

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:38.080
So where you literally just write down

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:39.840
anything that comes to mind

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.360
or that you feel like writing down

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.680
within a given period of time.

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:46.220
For most people, 10 minutes is ample time to do that.

01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:47.700
For some people, five will be enough.

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:51.080
And for some who have the time, maybe 30 minutes.

01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:53.640
But for me, and I think for most people out there,

01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:55.360
anywhere from five to 10 minutes

01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:57.600
of this data dump free association,

01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.240
it could be your anxieties, what you're thinking about,

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.240
what you're anxious about.

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:03.200
Really could be about anything that comes to mind.

01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:06.720
And this free association process can be very useful

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:09.680
for clearing out the clutter, so to speak.

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.400
The other style of journaling that's equally useful,

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:15.720
but for different reasons, is structured journaling

01:45:15.720 --> 01:45:19.420
to have a goal for a given entry on a given day.

01:45:19.420 --> 01:45:20.680
And again, this could be done in the morning,

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.000
afternoon or night.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.440
And the idea would be that you would set an intention,

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.960
and by intention, I mean a specific topic

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:30.120
that you're going to restrict your writing to.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:32.560
And that writing should be about self,

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:35.420
in particular goals and aspirations.

01:45:35.420 --> 01:45:38.440
What you've wanted in the past, yes,

01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.880
but also what you want at present,

01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:43.600
what you might want in the future for yourself.

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:45.880
These could of course be material things,

01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:49.320
but in general, this is more about aspirations

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:52.580
of things that you would like to accomplish or generate.

01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:54.160
And the key word there is generate.

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.120
And if you listen to the four episode series

01:45:56.120 --> 01:46:00.080
with Dr. Conti, he talked about three drives

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.480
that exist in all of us.

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.240
These three drives are the aggressive drive,

01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:07.200
the pleasure drive and the generative drive.

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:08.960
And we don't need to go into a lengthy description

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.360
about these drives right now.

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.260
If you're curious about them and what they represent

01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:16.280
and how they can be in balance or out of balance

01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:18.200
and how that serves us or doesn't serve us,

01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.960
please check out that four episode series

01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.840
with Dr. Conti, because he goes into that

01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:26.120
in a fair amount of detail and also in an actionable way.

01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:29.120
But the key thing here is that we're generative.

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.520
One of the things that I asked Dr. Conti at the outset

01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:34.360
and throughout the entire series was,

01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.160
what is mental health?

01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:38.400
We talk about physical health and we have some idea

01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:40.800
of what that represents, healthy blood pressure,

01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:43.120
the ability to do certain forms of physical movement,

01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.760
cognitive abilities.

01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:47.480
I asked him, how can we define mental health?

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.200
And his answer was very straightforward and very powerful.

01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:54.600
He said, what we all need to aspire to is to be in states,

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:58.800
that is in the verb actions of agency and gratitude

01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:01.480
for as much of our waking life as possible.

01:47:01.480 --> 01:47:02.560
Now that sounds great, right?

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.840
A sense of agency, the ability to exert influence

01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:07.960
over our internal state and affect the world around us

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.880
in positive ways, positive relationships,

01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:11.880
reach our goals, as well as gratitude,

01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:13.320
being grateful for the opportunities

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.560
that we've been afforded, even grateful perhaps

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:17.320
for some of the challenges that we've been afforded

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:19.400
or that were selected for us

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:21.440
that we had no control over

01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:24.440
and carrying that agency and gratitude forward

01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:26.680
because it gives rise to a sense of peace,

01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:28.280
contentment and delight.

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:30.440
So all of that sounds wonderful, right?

01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:33.120
Be in agency and gratitude as a verb states,

01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.440
experience peace, contentment and delight.

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.760
But Dr. Conti acknowledged,

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:39.200
and we spent a good amount of time discussing the fact

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.760
that doesn't happen just because we decide we want to.

01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:44.480
In fact, agency and gratitude,

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:46.040
peace, contentment and delight,

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:48.720
guys are up from a whole set of other processes

01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:51.560
that we have to engage in on a regular basis.

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:54.520
And that really gets us back to those three drives.

01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.440
He talked about how people tend to have

01:47:56.440 --> 01:47:58.200
more or less aggressive drive,

01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:00.560
not just aggression in terms of violence,

01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:02.000
although some people do have that,

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:03.880
but in terms of their determination

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.320
and their sort of leaning into friction,

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.760
even seeking out a friction.

01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.400
People are on a continuum

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:11.000
with respect to the aggressive drive.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.800
He also talked about the pleasure drive

01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:14.600
and the fact that people are on a continuum

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:18.920
of the desire for pleasure to either be a hedonist

01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.040
or somebody who really avoids pleasure

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.920
and kind of restricts pleasure from oneself.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:25.240
And again, that these things can slide around

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.960
depending on our life circumstances, our age, et cetera,

01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:31.960
but that it's very important that we have a sense

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:35.160
of where we are on that continuum of an aggressive drive

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.640
and a pleasure drive.

01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:39.920
And here's the most important thing,

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:42.120
that our aggressive drive and pleasure drive

01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:45.440
never outsize our generative drive.

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.680
And that engaging our generative drive

01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.640
is really the hallmark of mental health

01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:52.720
that leads to that sense of agency and gratitude,

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:54.320
peace, contentment and delight.

01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.720
And he defined the generative drive in the following way.

01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:00.240
He said, the generative drive is our desire to create,

01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:02.880
build and contribute to the world in meaningful ways

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.440
and appreciate the process to get there.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:08.320
It is the core feature of our mental health.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.160
So if you want to learn more about the various drives

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.880
and how they interact and how to access

01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:14.880
more generative drive, again, that's all contained

01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:17.120
in the four episode series with Dr. Conti,

01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:19.800
but taking us back to the tools and takeaways

01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.600
from that four episode series,

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.400
the process of journaling in free association mode

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.280
or the process of journaling in a conscious structured way

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:31.760
is really about trying to access the generative drive

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.480
and to build up that generative drive.

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:37.200
And one of the key things about conscious journaling

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:39.280
is that it affords us the opportunity

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:42.800
in a way that's not going to be seen by anybody else

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.040
to really think about what our goals and aspirations are.

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.320
Now you might say, you know,

01:49:47.320 --> 01:49:49.320
I can't even think about my goals and aspirations.

01:49:49.320 --> 01:49:50.800
I don't know what I want.

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:51.640
Well, that's fine.

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:53.000
Then you should journal about that.

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.720
However, most people have some sense of what they would like,

01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:59.640
but most people are simply not comfortable

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:02.920
with writing those things out or even thinking about them.

01:50:02.920 --> 01:50:05.240
And if you reflect on that, how could it ever be

01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:07.640
that you would achieve those goals and aspirations

01:50:07.640 --> 01:50:10.280
if you're not even feeling comfortable enough

01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.640
to think about them or write about them?

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.680
And so the process of thinking about

01:50:14.680 --> 01:50:17.360
and writing about your goals and aspirations

01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:20.320
is perhaps one of the key first steps

01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:23.880
towards being able to actualize those goals and aspirations.

01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:26.280
And for some people, this might be very easy to do.

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:27.320
You can simply write down, say,

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:29.240
I want to be married by this age,

01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:31.000
and I want to make X amount of money,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:32.480
and I want to live here or there.

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.200
And certainly those sorts of goals and aspirations

01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.600
are perfectly valid for this type of exercise,

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:40.040
but so are the sorts of goals and aspirations

01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:41.720
that relate to feeling states.

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:44.360
Like, yeah, I would like to feel part of a community.

01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:47.120
I would like to feel like an active contributor

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:48.200
to a community.

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.240
And then the essential thing is to really flesh out

01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.720
the detail around those goals and aspirations.

01:50:52.720 --> 01:50:54.160
You know, what size community?

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.560
Where do you see yourself fitting into this community?

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:59.280
Are you doing this alongside other people or by yourself?

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:02.040
In other words, to really get comfortable thinking

01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:03.960
about what your goals and aspirations are,

01:51:03.960 --> 01:51:07.080
again, completely from the perspective of self

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:09.080
and that you are going to be the only person

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:11.200
to see this particular document.

01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.640
Now, I will be the first to admit

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:15.160
that the exercise that I just described,

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.960
not the free association journaling,

01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:20.200
but the structured journaling of goals and aspirations,

01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:24.080
I and many people find to be difficult to initiate.

01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:25.880
Difficult to initiate because there seems to be

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:29.000
a bit of internal anxiety and friction around doing it.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.120
There seems to be something that keeps many, not all,

01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:36.160
but many people from feeling as if they are even allowed

01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:38.120
to think about their goals and aspirations

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:40.720
because many people default to, well, then, you know,

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:42.840
I'll just be disappointed because it's not going to work out.

01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:44.920
I don't want to think about what I want

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.800
because then I'll just be more disappointed.

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.040
And that particular frame of mind was actually discussed

01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:50.800
in the series with Dr. Conti.

01:51:50.800 --> 01:51:54.240
And he convinced me, and he's the expert,

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:57.340
that the opposite is actually true.

01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:59.600
When we are able to overcome some of our anxiety

01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.840
and really think about in a dedicated way

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:04.200
what we would like to create for ourselves in our lives,

01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:05.800
both present and future,

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:07.980
and keeping in mind our events of past

01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:11.060
because we always carry that life narrative forward,

01:52:11.060 --> 01:52:13.120
then we are in a far better place

01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:15.340
to actualize those goals and aspirations.

01:52:15.340 --> 01:52:17.720
And he explained a variety of reasons why that's the case

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:19.440
in his clinical observations

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:21.040
and some of the other observations

01:52:21.040 --> 01:52:22.400
that really support that statement.

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:25.020
So I highly encourage you to think about embracing

01:52:25.020 --> 01:52:26.060
a process of journaling.

01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:27.720
Again, you don't have to do this every day.

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:29.280
The journaling and the dream analysis

01:52:29.280 --> 01:52:30.660
take a little bit more time,

01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:32.460
but they are oh so valuable

01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:34.820
for better understanding oneself concept.

01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:39.020
And they really thread forward into real everyday actions

01:52:39.020 --> 01:52:42.100
that can positively enrich your mood and mental health.

01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:44.300
Now, any description of science-based tools

01:52:44.300 --> 01:52:46.620
for mood and mental health would be incomplete

01:52:46.620 --> 01:52:50.380
without including some tools related to processing of traumas.

01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:53.260
Now, the processing of traumas is something that,

01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:56.900
especially in the case of major traumas or repeated traumas,

01:52:56.900 --> 01:52:58.460
really should be carried out

01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:01.620
in concert with a expert-trained clinician.

01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:03.980
That is a psychologist or psychiatrist

01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:07.780
who's trained in helping people work through traumas.

01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:09.900
However, even if you're working with somebody

01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:11.840
who's expert in processing trauma,

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:15.020
there are specific tools that you can use on your own

01:53:15.020 --> 01:53:17.740
to accelerate that process.

01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:19.540
And for people who are working through

01:53:19.540 --> 01:53:21.980
what are sometimes called more minor traumas,

01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:24.060
these are sometimes called big T, big traumas,

01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:25.540
and little T, little traumas.

01:53:25.540 --> 01:53:28.380
However, that nomenclature doesn't take into account

01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:31.340
the fact that most of us can probably tell

01:53:31.340 --> 01:53:34.300
what the big traumas are for ourselves and for others,

01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:35.420
but sometimes it's hard to tell

01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:37.140
whether or not those small traumas,

01:53:37.140 --> 01:53:39.780
the little T traumas, actually are big T traumas.

01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:41.900
So this is one of the major reasons

01:53:41.900 --> 01:53:43.620
why working with a licensed professional

01:53:43.620 --> 01:53:45.140
is really going to be advantageous

01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:47.980
and in many cases necessary to work through trauma.

01:53:47.980 --> 01:53:51.220
That said, the self-directed protocols

01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:53.300
for working through trauma

01:53:53.300 --> 01:53:56.220
have a lot to do with how we think about,

01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:58.100
but more importantly at times,

01:53:58.100 --> 01:54:00.340
how we talk about those traumas.

01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:02.020
And Dr. Paul Conte talked about this,

01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:04.220
not so much in the four episode series with us,

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.660
but in a particular podcast episode

01:54:06.660 --> 01:54:08.780
that he did with Dr. Peter Attia,

01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:10.460
who some of you are perhaps familiar with

01:54:10.460 --> 01:54:12.820
for his incredible podcast, The Drive,

01:54:12.820 --> 01:54:15.300
but also for his excellent book, Outlive,

01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:18.860
which deals with health span and lifespan or longevity.

01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:20.860
Now, in that particular conversation

01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:23.340
with Dr. Conte and Dr. Attia,

01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:26.780
Dr. Conte emphasized the fact that one of the ways

01:54:26.780 --> 01:54:28.780
that we hold ourselves back

01:54:28.860 --> 01:54:32.820
and indeed can exacerbate the negative consequences of trauma

01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:35.700
are the ways in which we modify our language

01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:37.420
to describe those traumas.

01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:39.780
And what he said, which is so important,

01:54:39.780 --> 01:54:43.300
is that oftentimes we don't allow ourselves

01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:47.100
to use language that's as big as is necessary

01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:50.300
to explain that trauma and the impact of that trauma

01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.100
on us and on others.

01:54:52.100 --> 01:54:56.500
In fact, many people start to relegate their language

01:54:56.500 --> 01:54:59.100
to more passable in a given sentence

01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:01.300
or passable in a given conversation.

01:55:01.300 --> 01:55:04.260
Now, what we're not talking about here is the idea that,

01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:07.020
okay, you know, screaming at somebody else about your trauma

01:55:07.020 --> 01:55:08.940
or using a lot of four-letter words

01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:10.340
is necessarily the best way

01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:11.900
to process that trauma verbally.

01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:14.820
However, we are talking about allowing oneself,

01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:17.820
either in spoken form or in written form,

01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:20.500
to really allow the magnitude of a given trauma

01:55:20.500 --> 01:55:24.780
to be expressed with a fair degree of intensity

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:28.140
and language that can capture at least some

01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.580
of what that trauma represented for us or for others.

01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:33.660
Now, as Dr. Conte pointed out,

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.980
all too often we do the opposite.

01:55:35.980 --> 01:55:38.860
What ends up happening is people will experience

01:55:38.860 --> 01:55:41.260
some sort of trauma, either major or minor,

01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:43.380
maybe single or repeated trauma,

01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:46.540
and rather than being comfortable talking about it,

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:49.260
rather than using language that captures at least some

01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:52.020
of the magnitude of that trauma for them,

01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:56.220
people start to talk about that trauma less frequently.

01:55:56.220 --> 01:55:58.460
They start to distract themselves

01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.660
to think about other things instead of talking about

01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:02.220
or thinking about that trauma.

01:56:02.220 --> 01:56:04.860
And what happens is that trauma roots

01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.420
into our unconscious mind

01:56:06.420 --> 01:56:09.380
and starts to impact us in negative ways.

01:56:09.380 --> 01:56:13.060
Now, those negative ways include increases in anxiety,

01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:14.580
disruptions in sleep.

01:56:14.580 --> 01:56:17.220
In fact, one of the common ways in which trauma manifests

01:56:17.220 --> 01:56:19.500
in disruptions in sleep by way of rooting

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:23.660
into our unconscious is that people wake up at 2.30

01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:25.300
or three o'clock in the morning,

01:56:25.300 --> 01:56:27.660
let's just say after several hours of being asleep,

01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:30.140
and immediately they're thinking about that thing

01:56:30.140 --> 01:56:32.140
that happened and they're upset about it.

01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:34.780
The idea is that when we push those traumas down,

01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:37.780
when we don't talk about them with people that we trust,

01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:39.980
when we don't have a way to consciously process

01:56:39.980 --> 01:56:44.580
those traumas using language that at least partially matches

01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:48.180
the magnitude of the impact of those traumas for us,

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.180
well, then those traumas impact our unconscious mind

01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:53.260
in ways that lead our unconscious mind

01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.340
to literally wake us up in the middle of the night

01:56:55.340 --> 01:56:56.980
and remind us of that thing.

01:56:56.980 --> 01:56:58.980
It's as if it's being thrown back in our face

01:56:58.980 --> 01:56:59.900
over and over.

01:56:59.900 --> 01:57:02.180
Also, sometimes traumas will root their way down

01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:04.980
into our unconscious and then they will resurface

01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:08.740
in the mode of compulsive or obsessive thinking

01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:11.180
about that thing or perhaps other things.

01:57:11.180 --> 01:57:14.700
Again, the unconscious mind has a interesting

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:16.820
and complicated number of different ways

01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:21.820
that it defends us in ways that it can create denial,

01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:24.580
distraction, that we might get hyper-focused on work

01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:26.980
as a way to not think about the trauma

01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:29.500
or hyper-focused on some details in our environment

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:30.980
and just really trying to focus on that

01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:33.180
because it's much easier to process

01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:35.220
and handle that than these traumas.

01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:37.660
Again, the processing of trauma is a whole landscape

01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:42.060
into itself that actually was beautifully described

01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:44.660
in terms of how it arises within us

01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:48.220
and how to process traumas in a really structured way

01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:51.380
in a just fabulous book that was written by Dr. Conti

01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:53.260
called The Invisible Epidemic,

01:57:53.260 --> 01:57:55.660
How Trauma Works and How We Can Heal From It.

01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:57.860
And in that book, Dr. Conti explains a number

01:57:57.860 --> 01:58:00.340
of different ways that we can do self-directed work

01:58:00.340 --> 01:58:02.540
as well as work with licensed professionals

01:58:02.540 --> 01:58:05.100
to process traumas and help us move through those traumas

01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:08.540
so that they are not negatively impacting us going forward.

01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:11.060
So I really encourage anyone that's trying to process traumas

01:58:11.060 --> 01:58:14.340
from the past and or present to check out Dr. Conti's book

01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.300
because it's a spectacular resource.

01:58:16.300 --> 01:58:18.700
But in terms of the tools related to processing trauma

01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:20.620
that we're talking about right now,

01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:24.100
I think this point about really making sure

01:58:24.100 --> 01:58:27.620
that we allow ourselves to verbally process

01:58:27.620 --> 01:58:29.740
and emotionally process that trauma

01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:33.340
in a way that there's room for using language

01:58:33.340 --> 01:58:35.940
that captures some of the magnitude of that trauma

01:58:35.940 --> 01:58:38.460
and how it impacted us and others

01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.340
is going to be very important

01:58:40.340 --> 01:58:42.700
because otherwise what ends up happening

01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:46.460
is that we tend to adopt feelings of guilt and shame

01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:49.780
around those traumas simply by not talking about them,

01:58:49.780 --> 01:58:51.140
by having them go inward.

01:58:51.140 --> 01:58:53.540
And then they start to negatively impact

01:58:53.540 --> 01:58:55.780
our unconscious mind and then our unconscious mind

01:58:55.780 --> 01:58:57.260
tries to throw them up to the surface

01:58:57.260 --> 01:58:58.900
for our conscious mind to recognize

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:00.740
by waking us up from sleep.

01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:04.020
And in some cases, by leveraging those unhealthy defenses,

01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:07.580
things like denial, things like the overindulgence

01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:09.740
in alcohol, overindulgence of drugs,

01:59:09.740 --> 01:59:11.580
ways to distract ourselves,

01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:13.900
as well as projection and sublimation

01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:16.020
and the other types of defenses

01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:18.780
that Dr. Conti talked about in the four episode series.

01:59:18.780 --> 01:59:22.620
Again, those defenses are not necessarily good or bad.

01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:24.420
It depends on the circumstances.

01:59:24.420 --> 01:59:27.180
The unconscious mind is not trying to harm us.

01:59:27.180 --> 01:59:29.460
Your unconscious mind is part of you.

01:59:29.460 --> 01:59:30.740
It is you.

01:59:30.740 --> 01:59:33.140
But of course it is you acting in concert

01:59:33.140 --> 01:59:34.260
with your conscious mind.

01:59:34.260 --> 01:59:36.260
And so really the tools and protocols

01:59:36.260 --> 01:59:38.740
from the four episode series with Dr. Conti

01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:42.060
are aimed at helping you feel and access

01:59:42.060 --> 01:59:45.260
more sense of agency and gratitude on a regular basis,

01:59:45.260 --> 01:59:47.620
more peace, contentment and delight.

01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:51.860
And doing so by touching into those different drives,

01:59:51.860 --> 01:59:53.420
understanding what they are,

01:59:53.420 --> 01:59:55.300
the aggressive drive, the pleasure drive,

01:59:55.300 --> 01:59:58.060
and really making sure that your generative drive,

01:59:58.060 --> 02:00:00.100
again, I love this description of the generative drive

02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:01.660
so much so that I'm going to read it again,

02:00:01.660 --> 02:00:05.500
because this is really what it means to be mentally healthy.

02:00:05.500 --> 02:00:07.700
Again, the generative drive is our desire

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:09.660
to create, build and contribute to the world

02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:12.780
in a meaningful way and appreciate the process to get there.

02:00:12.780 --> 02:00:15.580
It is the core feature of our mental health.

02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:17.940
So being able to access that generative drive

02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:20.420
on a regular basis is really what this thing

02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:23.020
that we call mental health is all about.

02:00:23.020 --> 02:00:24.820
And the tools that I just described,

02:00:24.820 --> 02:00:27.180
of course can be combined with in any number

02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:29.060
of different ways with the tools that I described

02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:30.980
gleaned largely from the episode

02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:32.540
with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett.

02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:36.620
And so what you now have is a kit of tools and protocols

02:00:36.620 --> 02:00:38.100
for improving mood and mental health,

02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.740
some of which are grounded in that core six,

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:43.900
the first principles of self care

02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:46.340
are always going to be getting your physiology right

02:00:46.340 --> 02:00:48.900
so that your psychology can be right.

02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:51.620
As well, of course, you want to emphasize tools

02:00:51.620 --> 02:00:54.900
and protocols that build up your psychological processes

02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:56.180
and concept of self.

02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:58.620
That's what the tools from the Conti series

02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:00.300
that we just described are all about.

02:01:00.300 --> 02:01:02.700
And then the tools from the episode

02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:05.220
with Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett sort of bridge the two

02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:07.100
because she talked about both the physiological

02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:10.940
and the psychological tools that really represent ways

02:01:10.940 --> 02:01:12.580
to enhance our mood and mental health.

02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:15.500
And so by threading these three things together,

02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:17.940
I believe it really arms us with the greatest degree

02:01:17.940 --> 02:01:21.260
of optimism and capacity to take control of this thing

02:01:21.260 --> 02:01:22.980
that we call our mood and emotions,

02:01:22.980 --> 02:01:25.580
and to, of course, allow ourselves to feel

02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:26.780
the negative things we need to feel,

02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:28.540
but then process them in healthy ways

02:01:28.540 --> 02:01:31.460
and to exist as much as is reasonably possible

02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:35.380
in generally optimistic upbeat states

02:01:35.380 --> 02:01:38.540
that allow us to engage our generative drive.

02:01:38.540 --> 02:01:41.660
And although we covered a lot of tools during this episode,

02:01:41.660 --> 02:01:43.900
again, I want to emphasize that the idea

02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:46.340
isn't to necessarily do all of them all at once,

02:01:46.340 --> 02:01:48.460
maybe just pick one or two and start to implement them

02:01:48.460 --> 02:01:49.820
on a regular basis.

02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:52.260
And by implementing those, there's no reason to think

02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:53.940
that you would be significantly eating

02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:55.900
into your other demands on your time,

02:01:55.900 --> 02:01:57.740
because ultimately the whole purpose

02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:00.100
of having elevated mood and mental health

02:02:00.100 --> 02:02:02.420
is so that you can have better relationship to yourself

02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:04.220
and better relationship to others

02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:05.700
and to the world around you.

If you have questions for me or comments about the podcast

02:02:29.460 --> 02:02:31.260
or guests that you'd like me to consider hosting

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.780
on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:35.020
please put those in the comment section on YouTube.

02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:36.780
I do read all the comments.

02:02:36.780 --> 02:02:38.700
Not so much on today's episode,

02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:41.260
but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:42.460
we discussed supplements.

02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:44.300
While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:46.620
many people derive tremendous benefit from them

02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:50.340
for things like enhancing sleep, hormone support, and focus.

02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:51.940
To learn more about the supplements discussed

02:02:51.940 --> 02:02:53.500
on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

02:02:53.500 --> 02:02:56.140
you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,

02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:59.020
so that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

02:02:59.060 --> 02:03:00.940
If you're not already following me on social media,

02:03:00.940 --> 02:03:03.540
I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:06.740
So that's Instagram, X, formerly known as Twitter,

02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:08.620
Threads, LinkedIn, and Facebook.

02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:10.060
And on all those platforms,

02:03:10.060 --> 02:03:12.140
I discuss science and science-related tools,

02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:13.740
some of which overlaps with the content

02:03:13.740 --> 02:03:14.980
of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:16.940
but much of which is distinct from the content

02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:18.380
on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:21.580
So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.

02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:22.780
If you haven't already subscribed

02:03:22.780 --> 02:03:24.060
to the Huberman Lab Podcast

02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:26.100
monthly Neural Network Newsletter,

02:03:26.100 --> 02:03:27.220
the Neural Network Newsletter

02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:29.380
is a completely zero-cost newsletter

02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:31.900
that includes summaries of podcast episodes,

02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:32.980
as well as toolkits.

02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:36.500
Toolkits are brief PDFs that describe in bullet point form

02:03:36.500 --> 02:03:39.140
tools for, for instance, enhancing sleep,

02:03:39.140 --> 02:03:41.220
neuroplasticity, deliberate cold exposure,

02:03:41.220 --> 02:03:42.940
deliberate heat exposure, fitness,

02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:45.100
dopamine regulation, and much more.

02:03:45.100 --> 02:03:46.700

We do not share your email with anybody.

02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:57.140
Thank you once again for joining me

02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:00.340
for today's discussion, all about science-based tools

02:04:00.340 --> 02:04:02.700
for enhancing mood and mental health.

02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:04.900
And last, but certainly not least,

02:04:04.900 --> 02:04:06.740
thank you for your interest in science.
